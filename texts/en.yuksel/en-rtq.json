It invites us to always be conscious of the Day of Judgment in which God ALONE will judge our worldly choices and deeds. It underlines the importance of attaining freedom by submitting ourselves only to the Truth, and nothing but the Truth. It reminds us of the spiritual, individual, social, and political duties that will guide us on and to the straight path; additionally, it informs us of God's blessings to ancient communities and their various triumphs and blunders. For the literary aspect and purpose of shift in person, see the footnote of verse [[39:53]].</p>",
      "2": "<p>This first verse, shortly known as Basmalah, consists of four Arabic words and has a unique function in the Quran. It crowns every Chapter except Chapter 9. Basmalah is the foundation of a simple to understand, and impossible to imitate, interlocking mathematical structure intertwined in the text of the Quran and the Bible (We would like to remind the reader that this has nothing to do with numerological speculations or the statistically insignificant study published in the so-called Bible Code.) The miraculous function of the number 19 prophesized in Chapter 74 was unveiled in 1974 through a computerized analysis of the Quran. Though, in retrospect, the implication of 19 in Chapter 74 was obvious, it remained a secret for 1406 (19x74) lunar years after the revelation of the Quran. Ironically, the very first word of Chapter 74, The Hidden One, was revealing, yet the code was a divinely guarded gift allocated to the computer generation for they were the ones who would need and appreciate it the most. The following is just the tip of the iceberg: Basmalah consists of 19 letters and each of its words (Ism, Allah, Rahman, and Rahim), occurs in the Quran in multiples of 19. Many parameters of the mathematical structure of the Quran are related to this first verse. For instance, the missing Basmalah in the beginning of Chapter 9 is restored 19 chapters later inside Chapter 27. Thus, the frequency of this most repeated verse becomes 114 (19x6). The mathematical structure of the Quran has also resolved many scholarly arguments or mysteries. For instance, now we know why the Basmalah of the first Chapter is numbered while other Basmalahs in the beginning of chapters are not. As we have demonstrated in various books, through hundreds of simple and complex algorithms, we witness the depth and breadth of the mathematical manipulation of Arabic, an arbitrary human language, to be profound and extraordinary. This is indeed a fulfillment of a Quranic challenge ([[17:88]]). While the meaning of the Quranic text and its literal excellence were maintained, all its units, from chapters, verses, words to its letters were also assigned universally recognizable roles in creation of mathematical patterns. Since its discovery, the number 19 of the Quran and the Bible has increased the faith of many believers, has removed doubts in the minds of many People of the Book, and has caused discord, controversy and chaos among those who have traded the Quran with man-made sectarian teachings. This is indeed a fulfillment of a Quranic prophecy ([[74:30-31]]).</p><p>We translate the word ISM as NAME, but in the Arabic language and Arab culture, names are attributes. In fact, the word ISM shares the same root with the Arabic verb for \"describe\" ([[22:78]]; [[53:27]]; [[19:7]]). Like Hebrew, Arabic proper names are descriptive. God has all the beautiful attributes ([[7:180]]; [[17:110]]; [[20:8]]; [[59:24]]). Basmalah contains three names or attributes: Allah (the god; God), Rahman (Gracious), and Rahim (Compassionate/Caring/Loving). The Arabic word Allah is not a proper name as some might think; it is contraction of AL (the) and ELAH (god). The word Allahumma is a different form and the letter \"M\" in the end is not an Arabic suffix as a novice might think. The word Allahumma may not be considered a divine attribute since it cannot be used as a subject in a sentence or as an attribute of a divine subject. It is always used in supplication and prayers, meaning \"o my lord\" or \"o our lord.\" Allah and Rahman are two attributes that are invariably used as names rather than adjectives. Since God sent messengers to all nations ([[10:47]]; [[16:36]]; [[35:24]]) in their own language ([[14:4]]), they referred to their creator in their own language. See [[7:180]].</p><p>While some tried their hardest, for centuries, to turn the creator of the universe into an Arab God, others too have attempted to transform Him into an Anglo-Saxon male. The former ignored the fact that the languages of many nations who received God's message in their own language did not contain the word Allah. The latter ignored the fact that Jesus or (J)esu(s), never uttered the English word ‘God,’ but referred to his Lord with Hebrew or Aramaic words such as Eli, Eloi, Elahi, or Ellohim (Mark 15: 34), which are almost identical to corresponding Arabicwords.</p><p>The Old Testament contains several verses containing the attributes of ‘Gracious’ and ‘Merciful’ as used in Basmalah: Exodus 34: 6; 2 Ch 30: 9; Nehemiah 9: 17,31; Psalms 103: 8; 116: 5; Joel 2: 13; Jonah 4: 2.

      "1": "A1L30M40. The meaning of 14 differentcombinations of alphabet letters/numbers initializing29 chapters of the Quran remained a secret forcenturies until 1974. Many scholars attempted tounderstand the meaning of these initial letters with noresults. A computerized study that started in 1969revealed in 1974 a 19-based mathematical design thatwas prophesied in Chapter 74. The frequency of the14 alphabet letters in 14 different combinations thatinitialize 29 chapters are an integral part of thismathematical structure.Arabs, during the time of revelation, did not use whatwe now know as Arabic Numerals. A notable book,The Universal History of Numbers by George Ifrah,dedicates Chapters 17-19 to ancient numericalsystems, titled: Letters and Numbers, The Inventionof Alphabetic Numerals and Other AlphabeticNumber-Systems. The book provides extensiveinformation on the Hebrew, Armenian, Phoenician,Greek, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopian AlphabeticNumerals. According to historical evidence, duringthe era of Muhammad, Arabs were using theiralphabet as their numbering system. The Arabicalphabet then was arranged differently and wasnamed after its first four letters, ABJaD. Each of the28 letters of the alphabet corresponded to a differentnumber starting from 1 to 9, from 10 to 90, and thenfrom 100 to 1000. When Arabs started adoptingHindu numerals in 760 AC, long after the revelationof the Quran, they abandoned their alphabet/numeralsystem in favor of a pedagogically arranged alphabet,which is currently in use. Below is the list of the 28Arabic letters/numbers. When they are put next toeach other, their numerical values are added to eachother to attain a total number. For instance, thenumerical value of ALLaH (God) is 1+30+30+5=66,of ShaHYD (Witness) is 300+5+10+4=319, and ofWaHiD (One) is 6+8+4=19.Thus, the Quran is not only a literary book, but also abook made of numbers. The numerical structure ofthe Quran has two features: intertwined patternsamong the physical frequency of its literary units,such as letters, words, phrases, verses, and chaptersAND intertwined patterns among the numericalvalues (ABJaD) of these literary units. Consideringthe relevancy of the common meaning of words andletters during the time of revelation, we cannot ignorethe fact that the combinations of letters that initialize29 chapters are primarily numbers. After Arabscommonly adopted the Indian numerals in the 9thcentury, unfortunately, the numerical systemprevalent during the revelation became an antiqueabused by charlatan psychics, and astrologists. It isironic that an innovation (today's Arabic numerals)replaced the original (ABJaD), but through thepassage of time people started considering theoriginal to be the innovation! The allergy of Muslimscholars to ABJaD and its use in the Quran, does notallow them to open their eyes to marvels of thenumerically structured book ([[83:7-21]]).To verify and witness the mathematical system of theQuran, one does not need to know Arabic, though theknowledge of Arabic might increase the magnitude ofits appreciation. Though there are hundreds ofexamples of the 19-based mathematical system, thereare surely many still out there yet to be discovered.Meanwhile, there are also some issues that need to beresolved; for instance, the count of the letter Alif stillremains to be settled. We know the mathematicalstructure of the Quran verifies both the extraordinarynature of the text and its miraculous preservationfrom tampering. However, the system still involvesthe entire Quran and we have yet to discover amiraculous system verifying the divinity andauthenticity of each chapter, independently.Observers reacting to this prophetic feature fall intothree main groups: 1) unappreciative skeptics orfanatic religionists who reject its existence withoutsufficient investigation; 2) appreciative seekers oftruth who witness it and experience a paradigmchange; and 3) gullible people who are impressed byit without fully appreciating the statistical facts andconsequently indulge in \"discovering\" their own\"miracles\" through arbitrary numerical manipulationsand jugglery. Ironically, the third group’sexaggerated claims serve as justification for the firstgroup’s beliefs. For more information on this issue,please visit, 19.org.See [[74:1-56]]."

      "2": "We translated the word yuminun as \"theyacknowledge.\" The verbs and adjectives generatedfrom the root AMaNa have been translated withdifferent forms of the word believe.\" However,\"believe\" does not accurately describe the positivemeaning ascribed to the root AMaNa by the Quran.According to the Quran, guesswork, wishful thinking,following the majority, and believing withoutinvestigation and evidence, are not acts of AMaNa.The majority of people, according to the Quran, donot YuMiNun ([[11:17]]; [[12:103-107]]; [[13:1]]; [[40:59]]).Knowing that the majority of people do \"believe inGod\" or believe in some form of religious teachings,choosing to translate the appropriate Quranic phrase,say in [[12:103]], as \"the majority of people do notbelieve\" creates a contradiction. Belief in something,according to its common usage, may not needreasoning or acknowledgement of truth, butacknowledgement implies an intellectual process tosearch for and find the truth. Muminun are rationalmonotheists. No wonder the Quran repeats all thederivatives of the word AMN (acknowledge) 811times, while repeating all the derivatives of ALM(know) 782 times and of ARF (recognize) 29 times,totaling the same amount of times AMN(acknowledge) is mentioned, that is, 811.This verse, evaluated within the context of theQuranic precepts, does not mean that we shouldbelieve without evidence. The Quran categoricallyrejects blind faith or credulity ([[17:36]]). Unfortunately,the word belief or faith is commonly used as aeuphemism for wishful thinking or joining thebandwagon. Those who cannot justify their faiththrough deductive or inductive arguments, and thosewho cannot provide compelling reasons for why theybelieve certain dogmas and disbelieve others, are notconsidered muminun according to the definition ofthe word as used in the Quran. If the author of thescripture is also the creator of nature, and if it is Hewho is rewarding us with scientific knowledge andtechnology when we rationally and empiricallyinvestigate its laws, then why would He discourageus from using our mind and senses to investigateclaims about Him and words attributed to Him?Otherwise, schizophrenia or inconsistency becomedivine attributes. God is not at the end of a darktunnel of blind faith; but we can discover and get intouch with Him by tuning our minds and hearts toreceive His message broadcast in the frequency ofwisdom and knowledge. Therefore, according to thecontextual semantics of the Quran, faith or beliefdenote conviction as a result of reason andcompelling evidence. Thus, to distinguish theQuranic terminology of belief and faith from itscommon usage, we preferred the word\"acknowledge.\"A philosophical argument regarding the attributes ofGod is worth discussing. Plotinus, MosesMaimonides, and later Liebniz asserted that asimperfect beings we could not know God. How canlimited creatures like us comprehend divineattributes? This is a fair question. Indeed, knowing orcomprehending God is far beyond our capabilities.Do we really comprehend the meaning of Infinity,Perfection, Omnipotence, or Omniscience? Do wereally understand existence of a First Cause beyondtime and space? It is no easier to describe andcomprehend God than to describe and comprehendthe Singularity of the Big Bang or multiple universes,or quantum physics. As the Catholic philosopher, St.Augustine, cleverly argued, when we claim we do notcomprehend perfection, we show that we understandthe meaning of the word, for if we did not understandits meaning and implication, we would not be able toclaim that we do not comprehend it. Understandingthe meaning of a word or attribute without fullycomprehending it is interesting. It might simply meanthat we mentally distinguish a set from other setswithout knowing all its members.However, we can get a limited idea about Singularitythrough its offspring or effects; similarly, we can getan idea about God through His creation. Thus, all theattributes of God that we use are related and limitedto our environment and to us. To water molecules,the most important attribute of God might be COHA,the Combiner of Oxygen and Hydrogen Atoms, orthe Evaporator. To a whale, it might be the Creator ofPlanktons. To the stars in the galaxies, it is theDesigner of Fission, Creator of Gravity, or Gravityitself. Not only are we limited in comprehendingattributes that are related to us, but we are also unableto comprehend an infinite number of attributes, inrelation to other creatures, possible universes, or GodHimself. Our language is limited to our commonexperiences through the five senses and by theknowledge we gather through deductive andinductive inferences. Obviously, concepts, beings,and events beyond our experience and inferencescannot be communicated via human language; itwould be akin to attempting to describe the colors ofthe rainbow to a group of congenitally blind people.Nevertheless, possibility does not mean probability,let alone reality. Just as lack of direct evidence doesnot prove the existence of an asserted event or being,similarly not all proofs depend on direct evidence.The verse refers to the events and things whoseexistence and nature can be accepted through indirectevidence or inferences. These evidences andinferences are substantiated by a combination ofverifiable and falsifiable objective hypotheses as wellas personal experiences in harmony with theirobjective counterparts ([[41:53]]). Furthermore, theQuran acknowledges the maxim that extraordinaryclaims needs extraordinary evidence and it thusinforms us that all of God's prophets and messengerswere supported by ayat, that is, signs, evidences, ormiracles ([[2:211]]; [[6:4,142]]; [[11:64]]; [[13:38]]; [[29:50-51]];[[79:20]]). Though the Quran criticizes the dogmatic andprejudiced challenge of unappreciative people againsta messenger to demonstrate miracles, it approves ofthe requests by the sincere seekers of the truth towitness miracles to remove doubts from their hearts.Moreover, the Quran deems appreciation of miraclesas a sign of intelligence and objective thinking([[2:118]]; [[7:146]]).Not only do our five senses have limited capacity,their numbers too are most likely limited; we couldhave sixth, seventh, or more senses. A person blindfrom birth can never imagine the nature of color. Ifall humans were blind, the stars and galaxies, andalmost the entire universe would disappear. The raresighted person would not be able to prove theexistence of stars to the blind majority; the entireuniverse would thus be considered a metaphysicalconcept by the all-blind scientific community. In anisland inhabited by deaf people, a hearing personmight be able to prove his extraordinary ability todetect sound, but he would never be able to make thedeaf experience a similar auditory effect. It ispossible there are, perhaps, beings that can only bedetected by sixth, seventh, or Nth senses.The Arabic word ghayb means things, events, andfacts that are beyond the reach of our five senses orbeyond our access in time and space ([[31:34]]). Thereare known knowns, known unknowns, and unknownunknowns. Hundreds of years ago, bacteria, viruses,radio waves, genes, the sex of a child before birth,black holes, and subatomic particles were beyond ourperception and knowledge. Our five senses and ourbrain have a limited ability to perceive the externalworld, which we presume to exist; for instance, wecannot hear all sound waves and even dogs have amore acute hearing sense than us. We cannot seemost of the spectrum of light; many animals ormodern technological devices, such as radio and TV,are much better in their reception. Similarly, our nosecannot detect all the odor molecules; some insects aremuch better in smelling. Our knowledge of the worldhelps us invent and improve devices that increase thedomain and range of our five senses and these newhorizons, in turn, increase our knowledge further andhelp us invent newer devices. This perpetual process,as a byproduct, rewards us with technology, whichwe might use for good or bad ends.A reminder to English-speaking readers: In Arabic,the pronoun \"he\" or \"she\" does not necessarily meanmale or female, though the use of \"she\" is morerestricted (for instance, see [[16:97,111]]). Like inFrench, all Arabic words are grammatically feminineor masculine. Though God is referred by Arabicpronoun HU (He or It), God is never consideredmale. Christendom, greatly influenced by St. Paul'sstory of an incarnated god, has a propensity toenvision God as a sort of Superman. No wonderChristian cartoonists depict God as a bearded oldman. According to the Quran, God is beyondanything that we can imagine ([[42:11]]; [[6:103]]). Weentertained the idea of using the pronoun IT ratherthan HE for God, but we abandoned it since wethought it would create confusion."

As long as individualsfollow the religion of their parents or societies onfaith, without critical evaluation, they will not be ableto witness the divine evidence nor will they be guidedto the truth ([[6:110]]). For a brief discussion on thefreedom of choice, please see our discussion on[[57:22-23]].The Quran delineates three categories of people inthe context of their reaction to the truth:Acknowledgers, Rejecters, and Hypocrites. The firstand second groups are associated to each otherbecause they are opposites while the third group isassociated with the first two since it resembles both.The actions of acknowledgers associate them withparadise according to cause and effect. According tothe cause-and-effect rule of association, the actions ofunappreciative rejecters and hypocrites lead them tohell.We translated the word KaFeRun as \"ingrates.\" Theword KaFaRa means \"became unappreciative\" ofGod's blessings, such as reasoning, senses, revelation,messengers, life, health, friends, relatives, trust,liberty, provisions, etc. In only one verse, the wordKaFaRa is used to describe a positive rejection([[14:22]]). Mostly in early revelations during Meccanyears, the verb KaFaRa with its various derivativeswas used to literally mean unappreciative.\" Later, itssemantic evolves, transforming to a more specificand a more serious attitude; it becomes a definingcharacteristics of those who oppose the message ofthe Quran ([[2:152]]; [[27:40]]; [[31:12]]; [[76:3]]).The skeptical philosopher David Hume came up withan ingenious thesis claiming that there are only threeways of making associations between concepts:resemblance; congruity in space or time; and cause-effect. For instance, bees and ants may be associatedwith each other because of their resemblance of beinginsects working in a social structure. Bees andflowers may be associated with each other because oftheir congruity in space. Bees and honey may beassociated because of cause and effect since beesmake honey. Resemblance may include lack ofresemblance or resemblance in quantity. Weassociate the decimal system with our ten fingersboth because of their resemblance in quantity andassumed cause and effect relationship between them.The Quran, while using the already establishedassociations or relationships in our language, alsoemphasizes those relationships or creates new onesbetween concepts by either juxtaposing or contrastingthem within a particular context. Furthermore, theQuran is unique in creating a new semanticrelationship (we call it nusemantic from numericalsemantic) between concepts through theirfrequencies, verse numbers or numerical values oftheir letters. For instance, Jesus and Adam resembleeach other because they both lacked two parents. Itturns out their names are both mentioned exactly 25times in the Quran, thereby numericallystrengthening their relationship. Another example ofnusemantics: the Quran creates a special relationshipbetween the word ALLAH and the attribute \"The Onewith Great Bounties\" by making the frequency of theword ALLAH equal to the numerical value (notfrequency) of the letters comprising that attribute,that is, 2698. Extensive evidence of the numericalstructure of the Quran provides many nusemanticrelationships. For instance, the frequency of the wordYaWM (day) in its singular form in the Quran isexactly 365 times, thereby creating a nusemanticrelationship between the word DAY and SOLARYEAR rather than DAY and LUNAR YEAR, thusrejecting the claim of those who wish impose theknowledge of medieval Arabic culture, complete withthe use of a lunar year, onto the Quran. However, theplural word of day aYyAM (days) occurring 27 timesand the dual form YaWMayn (two days) occurring 3times, relate to the approximate number of days bothin a lunar and solar month. Similar nusemanticrelationships are extensive and were first observed byan Egyptian scholar Abdurazzaq al-Nawfal in the1960's and was published in Al-ijaz ul-Adady fil-Quran il-Karym (The Numeric Miracle/Challenge inthe Quran). For the prophecy regarding themathematical structure of the Quran, see [[74:30]]."

      "6": "These verses primarily refer to themathematical system of the Quran. The most popularposition among Muslim scholars is that the miracle ofthe Quran is its literary excellence. This is, however,an imaginary or false claim, since there is noobjective or universal criteria for comparing literarytexts and thereby preferring one over the other. Themiraculous nature of the Quran or the Quran's claimof divine authorship and its universal appeal cannotbe relegated merely to the literary taste of those whoknow Arabic, which may change subjectively. It isimpossible to argue that the Quran is divine bycomparing its literary aspects to those of Al-Mutanabbi, Taha Hussain or any other Arabic literarywork. Bukhari and Ibn Hanbal, the two so-calledauthentic hadith collections of Sunnism, tacitlyconfess the impossibility of distinguishing theQuranic statements from man-made literary workssince they narrate a text, which is still uttered bymillions of Sunni mushriks in bonus\" prayers callednawafil. According to their report, Ibn Masud, one ofthe most prominent comrades of prophet Muhammad,and allegedly one of the most prolific sources ofhadith, had included that prayer to his Quran as anindependent chapter while expunging the last twochapters. The claim of medieval Sunni and Shiitesources regarding the requirement for two witnessesfor each verse to authenticate their divine nature,regardless of the truth-value of the claim, is anotheracknowledgment of their inability to distinguish aQuranic revelation from fabricated statements via theso-called literary excellence criterion. See [[4:82]];[[10:20]]; [[74:30]], and the Appendix titled On it Nineteen."

I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath anddoubting.

      "15": "Belief in intercession is a mythologycommon in many religions. Satan, via religiousclergymen, infected the faith of many people with thevirus called intercession. Intercession generates falsehope that promotes human-worship. The livingreligious leaders distinctly discover the power ofintercession for their political and economicexploitation: if their followers believe that \"holy deadhumans\" could bestow them eternal salvation andsave them from God's justice, then they would bemore susceptible to follow their semi-holy leadersblindly.None has the power of saving criminals from God'sjudgment. The Quran considers the faith inintercession to be shirk or polytheism. If there is anyintercession, it will be in the form of testimony forthe truth ([[2:48,123,254]]; [[6:70,94]]; [[7:53]]; [[10:3]]; [[20:109]];[[34:23]]; [[39:44]]; [[43:86]]; [[74:48]]; [[78:38]]). Ironically, theQuran informs us that Muhammad will complainabout his people deserting the Quran, not \"his sunna\"as they claim ([[25:30]]). If there were any intercessionby Muhammad, this would be the one.Muhammedans are so ignorant and arrogant, liketheir ancestors, that they too are in denial of theirassociating partnership with God through attributingthe power of intercession, or other false powers, toGod's servants ([[6:23-26]]; [[16:35]]; [[17:57]]; [[39:3]], 38;[[19:81-82]]). Those who acknowledge the Quran do notfavor one messenger over another ([[2:285]]), since allthe messengers belong to the same community([[21:92]]; [[23:51-53]]).The Quran gives examples of many idolized conceptsand objects. For instance, children ([[7:90]]), religiousleaders and scholars ([[9:31]]), money and wealth([[18:42]]), angels, dead saints, messengers and prophets([[16:20]], 21; [[35:14]]; [[46:5]], 6; [[53:23]]), and ego/wishfulthinking ([[25:43]], [[45:23]]) all can be idolized.In order to infect the human mind with the mostdangerous disease called shirk (associating partnerswith God, or polytheism), Satan infects theunappreciative minds with a virus that destroys thefaculty of recognition and self-criticism. As a result,the faulty and defective recognition program handsthe mind over to the Satan’s control. Therefore, mostof those who associate partners with God in variousways do not recognize their polytheism ([[6:23]]).Polytheists show all the symptoms of hypnosis; theirmaster hypnotist is Satan.We are instructed to glorify and praise God ([[3:41]];[[3:191]]; [[33:42]]; [[73:8]]; [[76:25]]; [[4:103]]), not Hismessengers, who are only human beings like us. Weare instructed by the Gracious and Loving God toutter the name of messengers by their first names,without glorifying them, and Muhammad is nodifferent from other messengers ([[2:136]]; [[2:285]];[[3:144]]). Muhammad was a human being like us([[18:110]]; [[41:6]]), and his name is mentioned in theQuran as Muhammad, similar to how other people arementioned in the Quran ([[3:144]]; [[33:40]]; [[47:2]]; [[48:29]]).Uttering expressions containing salli ala afterMuhammad's name, as is commonly done by Sunniand Shiites alike, is based on a distortion of themeaning of a verb demanding action of support andencouragement of a living messenger, rather thanutterance of praise for a dead messenger (compare[[33:56]] to [[33:43]]; [[9:103]]; and [[2:157]]). Despite theseverses clarifying the meaning of the word; despite thefact that the Quran does not instruct us to saysomething, but to do something; despite the fact thatthe third person pronoun in the phrase indicates that itwas an innovation after Muhammad's departure;despite these and many other facts, Sunni and Shiiteclerics try hard to find an excuse to continue thisform of Muhammad worship. Contradicting theintention and practice of the masses, some clericseven claim this phrase to be a prayer for Muhammadrather than a phrase for his praise. Muhammad,especially the Muhammad of their imaginations,should be the last person who would need theconstant prayers of millions. According to them,Muhammad already received the highest rank inparadise, and again according to them he did notcommit any sins. Therefore, the addressee of theirprayers is wrong. They should pray for themselves,and for each other, not for Muhammad. It is akin tohomeless people donating their dimes, several times aday, to the richest person in the world. It is just asabsurd.A great majority of Sunni and Shiite mushriksdeclare their peaceful surrender to God alone whilestanding in their prayers, but immediately nullify thatdeclaration twice while sitting down. They first tellGod, \"You alone we worship; you alone we ask forhelp\" and then forget what they just promised God bygreeting \"the prophet\" in the SECOND person,\"Peace be on YOU o prophet!\" (as salamu alayKAayyuhan nabiyyu), as if he was another omnipotentand omniscient god. They give lip service tomonotheism while standing, and they revert toconfessing their idolatry when sitting. Those whobetray the meaning of \"the ruler of the day ofjudgment\" which they utter numerous times in theirprayers ([[1:4]]; [[82:17-19]]), those who contradict thepurpose of the prayer ([[20:15]]), are obviously thosewho are oblivious to their own prayers ([[107:4-7]];[[8:35]]). In defiance of the Quran, many sects andmystic orders competed with each other to putMuhammad in a position that Muhammadunequivocally rejected ([[39:30]] and [[16:20]], 21). Alsosee, [[2:123,254]]; [[3:80]]; [[5:109]]; [[6:51]]; [[6:70,82,94]]; [[7:53]];[[9:80]]; [[10:3,18]]; [[13:14-16]]; [[19:87]]; [[21:28]]; [[33:64-68]];[[34:23,41]]; [[39:3,44]]; [[43:86]]; [[53:19-23]]; [[74:48]]; [[83:11]].After the departure of Jesus, the Pharisee Paul turnedJesus into a divine sacrifice and a middle manbetween his flock and God: \"For there is one God,and one mediator between God and men, the manChrist Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, tobe testified in due time\" (1 Timothy [[2:5-6]]). TheCatholic Church went even further and added Maryand numerous saints to the ranks of the holy powerbrokers.The followers of Sunni and Shiite sects follow asimilar doctrine. They replace one idol with another,and consider Muhammad to be \"the mediator\"between God and men; they assert that withoutaccepting Muhammad, none can attain salvation!Following the tradition of Paul, and then the traditionof Catholic Church, they too produced their ownsaints, thereby creating a Pyramid scheme ofmediators. Interestingly, some later idols havesurpassed the main idol in popularity. For instance, inIran, people worship the second-generation idol, Ali,more than they worship Muhammad. They invokeAli's name on almost every occasion. In Syria, athird-generation idol, Hussain, is more popular thanboth Ali and Muhammad. The long list of idols variesfrom country to country, from town to town, fromorder to order, and even includes the names of livinglocal idols as well."

Based on these criteria, Socrates whorisked his life for promoting dialectic reasoning andrejecting the polytheistic religion of his countrymenwas a muslim. Similarly, Maimonides whoconsidered God as the Prime Mover, Rabi Judah benSamuel who witnessed one of the greatest divinesigns and stood against religious distortion, Leibnizwho regarded God as the creator and coordinator ofmonads, Galileo who studied and appreciated God'ssigns in the heavens and stood against religiouscharlatans, Darwin who traveled the world andstudied God's biological creation with diligence andopen mind, Newton who studied God's laws in theuniverse and showed the wisdom and courage toreject Trinity and deity of Jesus by arguing that thisChristian doctrine to be contradictory to the firstCommandment in the scripture, and many of thosewho fit the description of the Quranic verse [[2:62]], yesall according to the Quran might be consideredmuslims.Those who judge a person's eternal salvation bywhether they carry an Arabic name or not, are notfollowing the Quranic definition of islam; insteadthey are following a diabolic definition made by Arabnationalists.The conditions listed in this verse are explained indetail within the context of the Quran. For instance, aperson is not considered to be acknowledging God ifhe or she associates partners or ordained mediatorswith Him, or follows the teachings and restrictionsfalsely attributed to Him. Furthermore, such a beliefis not accepted if it is mere lip service or to conformto a particular group; it must be based on reason,evidence, and intuition. Acknowledging the hereafterimplies acknowledging the hour, the day ofresurrection and the day of judgment in which noneexcept God will be the sole authority. Leading arighteous life is also defined in the Quran. Forinstance, righteousness requires a desire and action ofsharing a portion of one's possessions--be itknowledge, talents, services, or wealth--with others,while appreciating his or her own. It also meansmaintaining honesty, integrity, and justice with goodintention, while fighting against aggression andoppression.The Quran refers to the followers of the NewTestament with the word Nasara (Nazarenes), ratherthan Masihiyyun (Christians). The root of the wordhas several implications. First, it might haveoriginated from the Semitic word NaSaRa (tosupport), and originated from the answer given by thedisciples of Jesus when he asked for their support forhis cause ([[61:14]]). Or, it could have originated fromthe birth place of Jesus, Nazareth. Perhaps, it has alinguistic and historical link to both origins. Also, see [[5:82]].Knowing the motive of the Gospel authors toestablish a stronger messianic link between Jesus andKing David, by binding him through genealogy andbirthplace, some scholars of theology justifiablyquestion whether Bethlehem was the actualbirthplace of Jesus, as is commonly accepted. ThoughMatthew acknowledges the fact that Jesus was calledNazarene (Matthew [[2:23]]), both Matthew and Lukemention Bethlehem as his birthplace. However,Mark, which was written earlier, mentions Nazarethas the birthplace of Jesus instead of Bethlehem: \"Andit came to pass in those days, that Jesus came fromNazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John inJordan\" (Mark [[1:9]]). For the Biblical verses referringto Nazareth, see (Matthew [[2:23]]; [[4:13]]; [[21:11]]; [[26:71]];Mark [[1:9,24]]; [[10:47]]; [[14:67]]; [[16:6]]; Luke [[1:26]]; [[2:4,39,51]]; [[4:16,34]]; [[18:37]]; [[24:19]]; John [[1:45-46]]; [[18:5,7]]; [[19:19]]; Acts [[2:22]]; [[3:6]]; [[4:10]]; [[6:14]]; [[10:38]]; [[22:8]]; [[26:9]]).According to Christian scholars, such as Easton, \"Thename Christian was given by the Greeks or Romans,probably in reproach, to the followers of Jesus. It wasfirst used at Antioch (Acts [[11:26]]). The names bywhich the disciples were known among themselveswere 'brethren,' 'the faithful,' 'elect,' 'saints,''believers.' But as distinguishing them from themultitude without, the name 'Christian' came into use,and was universally accepted. This name occurs butthree times in the New Testament (Acts [[11:26]]; [[26:28]];1Peter [[4:16]]).\" It seems that some followers of Jesusadopted the name attributed to them by their enemies,and some continued using one of their earlier names,Nazarenes.As for the word Sabiene, it is mistranslated as aproper name by the majority of commentators. Infact, it derives from the Arabic word SaBaA, meaningto be an apostate, or ‘the follower of other religions.’Hadith books use this word as an accusation ofMeccan mushriks directed against Muhammad whenhe started denouncing the religion of his people; theydescribed his conversion to the system of Islam withthe verb SaBaA."

The resurrection of thecow was to pull their attention to the fact thatresurrection is easy for God, just as easy as creationin the first place. The Quran does not repeat theBiblical assertion that the sacrifice was for removingthe guilt of murdering an innocent person.By reminding us of this event, which is narrated inthe Old Testament, Numbers 19, we are expected notto repeat the errors committed by the Jews.Ironically, Muslims repeated them to the letter.Muslims, soon after the prophet's death, starteddoubting the sufficiency and completeness of theQuran and asked many irrelevant and ridiculousquestions. To answer those trivial questions, manypeople fabricated stories and instructions andattributed them to Muhammad and his companions.Two centuries after Muhammad's departure, someignorant zealots such as Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmizi,Abu Dawud, Nasai, and Ibn Hanbal started collectingand classifying the stories in numerous hadith books.These volumes of contradictory \"holy fabrications\"created a new occupation termed emamet, ijtihad orfiqh. Therefore, many emams, mujtahids, or fuqahacreated numerous sects and orders by interpreting,reconciling, refuting and codifying these volumes ofcontradictory sources. These books fabricatednumerous rules that included answers to frivolousquestions such as: 1) in what order must one cut hisfingernails, 2) with which feet must one enter thebathroom, or 3) with which hand must one eat? Theblind followers of hadith and sunna are hypnotizedinto believing that they would not even be able toproperly clean themselves in the bathroom unlessthey followed those teachings. Sectarian bookscontain chapters of extensive, yet primitive andoccasionally unhealthy religious instructions onpersonal hygiene. Thus, God's system wastransformed into the religion or sect of this or thatscholar, and the medieval Arab culture andborrowings from Christians and Jews were sanctified.Through this story, God pulls our attention to thechronic cause of distortion and corruption in religion.Unfortunately, Muslims repeated the same blunder.See [[5:6,101]]; [[23:52-56]]; [[42:21]]."

The first fivebooks of the Old Testament are attributed to Mosesbut there are many clues that indicate they werewritten long after Moses by anonymous authors. Forinstance, there are many verses in the first five booksreferring to Moses as a third person, and the lastchapter of Deuteronomy is dedicated to Moses' death,which contains the following statements, \"And Mosesthe servant of the Lord died there in Moab Sincethen, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses\"Obviously, a dead person could not have written hisown obituary.This is just one of the many evidences showing thatnot only the divine nature of the Old Testament, buteven the identity of its alleged human authors, is inquestion.

Furthermore, bydistorting the meaning of [[2:106]], they claimed thatmany verses of the Quran had been abrogated(amended) by other verses or hadiths. By this\"abrogation theory,\" they amended verses which theydid not understand, or which did not suit theirinterests, or which contradicted their hadiths.Repeating the same error committed by the Childrenof Israel ([[2:85]]), Muslims fulfilled the propheticdescription of their action in [[15:91-93]]. Some of themabrogated 5 Quranic verses, some 20 verses and some50.They support this claim by distorting the meaning ofthis verse. The Quran has a peculiar language. Theword Aya in its singular form occurs 84 times in theQuran and in all cases, means miracle, evidence, orlesson. However, its plural form, Ayat, is used bothfor miracle, evidence, lesson, AND/OR for thelanguage of the revelation that entails or leads tothose miracles, evidences, and lessons. The fact that averse of the Quran does not demonstrate themiraculous characteristics of the Quran supports thispeculiar usage or vise versa. There are short versesthat are comprised of only one or two words and theywere most likely frequently used in dailyconversation, letters and poetries. For instance, theverse \"Where are you going?\" cannot be called AYAT(signs) since it is one verse. This is very appropriate,since that expression was and is used by Arabicspeaking people daily, even before the revelation ofthe Quran.However, in its semantic and numerical context, thatshort question is one of the Ayat of the Quran. See[[55:3]]; [[69:1]]; 74; 4; [[75:8]]; [[80:28]]; [[81:26]]. Furthermore,we are informed that the minimum unit thatdemonstrates the Quran's miraculous nature is achapter ([[10:38]]) and the shortest chapter consists ofthree verses (chapters 103, 108, and 110). The firstverse of the Quran, commonly known as Basmalah,though containing independent features, may not beconsidered a divine evidence/miracle on its own.However, it gains a miraculous nature with itsnumerical network with other letters, words, versesand chapters of the Quran. By not using the singularform Aya for the verses of the Quran, God also madeit possible to distinguish the miracles shown in thelanguage and prophecies of the scripture from themiracles shown in nature. See [[4:82]] and [[16:101]] forfurther evidence that the Quranic verses do notabrogate each other.Since grammatically we can refer only to three verseswith the plural word, ayat, and since we are notprovided with a word to refer to a single or pair ofverses, this unique use might have anotherimplication: are we required to quote the Quranicverses in segments of at least three verses? Will thismethod eliminate the abuse of Quranic statements bytaking them out of their context? I think this questionneeds to be studied and tested. If quoting verses ofthe Quran in minimums of three units reasonablyeliminates the abuse, then we should adhere to such arule.For another example of different meanings assignedto singular and plural forms of the same word, see[[4:3]].

Kaba is not a holy temple or shrine, but anannual gathering place for monotheists tocommemorate God, to remember the struggles ofmonotheists throughout history, to get to know eachother, to exchange information, to promote charity, toremember their commonalities regardless of theirdifferences in color, culture and language, to discusstheir political and economical issues amicably, and toimprove their trade.The Quran informs us that those who associate otherauthorities with God continued the tradition ofAbraham, only in form. Before the verses orderingmuslims to turn to Kaba as qibla were revealed,muslims, like mushriks were turning towards Kaba.Muslims suffering from the repression, oppressionand torture of Meccan polytheists finally decided toemigrate to Yathrib and there they established a city-state. However, the Meccan theocratic oligarchy didnot leave them alone. They organized several majorwar campaigns. The aggression of the Meccanoligarchy and the improving economic, politic andsocial relations between muslims and the people ofthe book, that is Christians and Jews, led muslims toturn to another uniting point. They picked Jerusalem.Nevertheless, God wanted muslims to turn back totheir original qibla, al-Masjid al-Haram (therestricted place of prostration). We understand thisfrom verses [[2:142-145]]. These verses asking muslimsto turn back to their former qibla in Mecca created adifficult test for some muslims living in Yathrib.Those who preferred the advantages of personal,social and economic relations with the Christian andJewish community in Yathrib and those who couldnot get over their emotional grievances against theMeccan community could not accept this change andreverted back from islam ([[2:142-144]]).In brief, the verses ordering the change of qibla didnot abrogate another verse, since there is not a singleverse ordering muslims to turn to another qibla. Ifthere is an abrogation, the decision of Muhammadand his companions to turn away from Kaba wasabrogated.Here are some relevant verses from the Bible: \"Inthose days, and in that time, says the Lord, thechildren of Israel shall come, they and the children ofJudah together, going and weeping: they shall go, andseek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way toZion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, andlet us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetualcovenant that shall not be forgotten\" (Jeremiah [[50:4]]-5). \"My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts ofthe Lord: my heart and my flesh cries out for theliving God. Yea, the sparrow hath found an house,and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may layher young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, myKing, and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in thyhouse: they will be still praising thee. Selah. Blessedis the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heartare the ways of them. Who passing through the valleyof Baca make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.They go from strength to strength, every one of themin Zion appears before God. O Lord God of hosts,hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face ofthine anointed. For a day in thy courts is better than athousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house ofmy God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. Forthe Lord God is a sun and shield: the LORD will givegrace and glory: no good thing will he withhold fromthem that walk uprightly. O Lord of hosts, blessed isthe man that trusts in thee\" (Psalms [[84:2-12]])"

    "r": {
      "60": "The root of the Arabic word we translated as\"intoxicants\" is KhaMaRa and it means \"to cover.\" Ifits first letter is read with Ha (9) rather than Kh (600),it then means Red, referring to red wine (For theusage of Hamar in the Bible, see Deuteronomy[[32:14]]; Isaiah [[27:2]] Ezra [[6:9]]; [[7:22]]; Daniel [[5:1-2,4]]).We prefer its common pronunciation. Sometranslations, while accepting the same pronunciation,have erroneously restricted the meaning of the wordby translating it as \"wine\" or \"liquor.\" Consumptionof all intoxicants, be they alcoholic beverages, drugs,crack, cocaine, heroin, etc. are covered by thisprohibition. The harm inflicted to individual andsociety by alcoholic beverages, drugs and gamblingis enormous. See [[5:90-91]].The Quran does not prohibit alcoholic beverages ordrugs legally, and thus does not suggest anypunishment for mere usage of alcohol. Hadith booksordaining severe penalties for the consumption ofalcohol contradict the Quranic jurisprudence, sincepeople's personal choices, how bad they may be,cannot be penalized by society. Society can onlypunish acts that are direct or proximate causes ofharm to another person or persons. Besides, puttinglimitations on individual rights wastes society'sresources, increases corruption, hypocrisy, andunderground criminal activities, and other crimes.Legally banning and criminalizing the consumptionand production of alcohol, a liquid drug, at the turn of20th century proved to be a bad idea. Similarly,criminalizing the consumption of other drugs is also abad idea. Society's resources should be used for theprevention and rehabilitation of these kinds ofsocially and psychologically caused addictions.However, the Quran prohibits intoxicants toindividuals for various reasons, including: moral (thedesigner and creator of your body and mind asks younot to intentionally harm the body lent to you for alifetime), intellectual (the greatest gift you have isyour brain and its power to make good judgment, sodo not choose to be stupid or more stupid than youalready are!) and pragmatic (you and your societywill suffer grave loss of health, wealth, happiness,and many lives; do not contribute to the productionand acceleration of such a destructive boomerang).The common justification for using alcohol, \"I drinkin moderation,\" is not convincing, since almost allthose who suffer from alcohol abuse or itsconsequences such as drunk driving, had started withmoderation, sip by sip, and gradually increased thedosage because of peers or uncontrollable events intheir lives. Today's moderate drinker may betomorrow's addict. Why take the chance, especiallywhen it is not a necessity? Stupidity in moderation isnot something to be justified, let alone glorified.Rational people should not subject themselves andthe society to the grave risks inflicted by alcohol.Besides, moral people should not support an industrythat hurts a big segment of the society. The anecdotal\"research\" results that are occasionally advertised bythe media claiming that the usage of wine or alcoholin moderation to be healthy for the heart is suspect,since beer and wine companies are major supportersof the media through commercials.Many correlations are ignored by the so-calledresearchers. For instance, studying the impact of wineconsumption on health, without taking into accountthe income, health insurance, diet, lifestyle, geneticmake up, and environment of wine-drinkers, will notproduce a reliable cause-and-effect relationship.Interestingly, some of the health benefits attributed toalcohol have been listed for grape juice, though inhigher doses. Even if alcohol or any other drug hadsome economic, social and even health benefits, theQuran reminds us of the proven fact that their harmsoutweigh their benefits.The Bible contains contradictory messages regardingthe use of wine or alcoholic beverages. The Hebrewequivalent of the Quranic word Sakar ([[16:67]]; [[4:43]]) isShekar (intoxicant) and it is criticized by the OldTestament (Leviticus [[10:9]]; Judges [[13:4]], Isaiah [[28:7]];Isaiah [[5:11]]; [[24:9]]; [[29:9]]; [[56:12]]; Joel [[3:3]]; Amos [[6:6]]; Pr[[20:1]]; [[31:6]]; Micah [[2:11]]). Wine impairs the health,judgment and memory (1 Samuel [[25:37]]; Hosea [[4:11]];Peter [[31:4-5]]), inflames the passions (Isaiah [[5:11]]), andleads to sorrow, contention and remorse (Peter [[23:29]]-32). Wine also cheers God and man (Judges [[9:13]];Zechariah [[9:17]]; Psalms [[104:15]]; Esther [[1:10]];Ecclesiastes [[10:19]]), and strengthens the body(2Samuel [[16:2]]; Song [[2:5]]).Though the consumption of wine is occasionallyapproved and even encouraged through the dailysacrifice (Exodus [[29:40-41]]), with the offering of thefirst-fruits (Leviticus [[23:13]]), and with various othersacrifices (Numbers [[15:4-10]]), the Bible also containssome prohibitions. For instance it prohibits wine forthe Rechabites (Jeremiah [[35:1-19]]), the Nazirites(Judges [[13:7]]; Luke [[1:15]]; [[7:33]]), and the priests whenengaged in their services (Leviticus [[10:1]], 9-11). Italso lists wine as offerings of idolatry (Deuteronomy[[32:37-38]]).The Hebrew Bible uses about a dozen words to referto different kinds of alcoholic beverages (Ashisha,Asis, Hemer, Enabh, Mesekh, Tirosh, Sobhe, Shekar,Yekebh, Shemarim, Mesek). However, some Biblicalscholars limit the application of this prohibition bytranslating the Shekar as \"strong drink.\" The majorityof Christian sects have no religious inhibitionregarding the consumption of alcohol. Easton, aJesus-worshipping tri-theist, writes: \"Our Lordmiraculously supplied wine at the marriage feast inCana of Galilee (John [[2:1-11]]).\"The New Testament also contains warnings forpeople against the excess consumption of intoxicants(Luke [[21:34]]; Romans [[13:13]]; Ephesians [[5:18]]; 1Timothy [[3:8]]; Titus [[1:7]]). But, in the same volume, wealso see wine moving from lip to lip as a sacreddrink. According to the Gospels, Jesus turns water towine (John [[4:46]]) and wine has a prominent place inPassover and the Last Supper. While Mark [[15:23]]serves Jesus wine in his last moments, Matthew[[27:34]] serves him vinegar. It is obvious that theGospel authors could not differentiate betweenvinegar and wine.The contradictory position regarding wine oralcoholic beverages reaches absurdity when Jesusallegedly declared wine to be memorials of his bodyand blood. The Book of Revelation, a theo-fictionalnightmare, mixes wine with the numerically definedbeast and hell fire. \"And the third angel followedthem, saying with a loud voice, If any man worshipthe beast and his image, and receive his mark in hisforehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of thewine of the wrath of God, which is poured outwithout mixture into the cup of his indignation; andhe shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in thepresence of the holy angels, and in the presence ofthe Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendethup for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nornight, who worship the beast and his image, andwhosoever receiveth the mark of his name\"(Revelations [[14:9-11]]).It seems that the words grape juice, vinegar, literalwine, and metaphorical wine, may all be mixed up inthe Bible due to some intentional tampering duringits oral or written transmission, and the errorscommitted during translations of other translations."

See [[9:34-35]].Verse [[2:228]] establishes equal rights to both genders.By associating and even preferring numerouscollections of lies and innovations to the Quran, thefollowers of hadith and sunna denied Muslim womenthe right to divorce and turned them into slaves ofmale despotism.Divorce is a legal event lasting several months; it isnot just an oral declaration of the male spouse. Awife cannot be divorced by announcing, \"I divorceyou three times.\" Furthermore, the divorce must bedeclared by a court, with the participation of bothparties and witnesses.

The Quran rejectsthe imposition of a religion over another andpromotes the Islamic system that can be summarized,in modern terms, as federal secularism ([[5:43-48]]).Thus, the city-state of Yathrib led by Muhammad,who did not accept any other authority besides theQuran ([[6:114]]), established a successful example of afederal secular system by dividing the territory intoindependent legal jurisdictions to accommodate thediverse religious, social, and political preferences ofits communities. The relations between those whoaccepted the Quran as their jurisdiction and thosewho followed other laws were determined accordingto a constitution drafted and signed by all parties.Some critics take verse [[9:3]] out of its context andpresent it as a contradiction with the principleexpressed in [[2:256]] and other verses. Chapter 9 startswith an ultimatum against Meccan mushriks who notonly tortured, killed, and evicted muslims from theirhomes but also mobilized several major warcampaigns against them while the muslimsestablished a peaceful multi-national and multi-religious community. The beginning of the Chapterrefers to their violation of the peace treaty and givesthem an ultimatum of four months to stop aggression.Thus, the verses quoted from Chapter 9 have nothingto do with freedom of religion; it is a warning againstaggressive, murderous religious fanatics.As for [[9:29]], the word jizya in that verse has beenmistranslated as a taxation of non-muslims, while theword means \"compensation\" or more accurately,\"war reparation,\" which was levied against theaggressing party who initiated the war. See [[9:29]];[[6:68]]. Also see [[2:193]]; [[4:140]]; [[10:99]]; [[18:29]]; [[74:55]];[[80:12]]; [[88:21]], 22.The Bible contains some verses emphasizing theimportance of freedom, justice, and human rights.\"When all the prisoners in a country are crushedunderfoot, when human rights are overridden indefiance of the Most High, when someone is cheatedof justice, does not the Lord see it?\" (Lamentations[[3:34-36]]). \"He has sent me to proclaim liberty tocaptives, sight to the blind, to let the oppressed gofree\" (Luke [[4:18]]). On the other hand, the OldTestament contains some verses that show notolerance for other religions or religious beliefs.

Furthermore, such aninterpretation, which relies on hadith and sunna,contradicts other verses of the Quran ([[24:6-9]]; [[3:195]]).Verse [[49:13]] unequivocally rejects sexism and racism,and reminds us that neither man nor female, neitherthis race nor that race is superior over the other. Theonly measure of superiority is righteousness; being ahumble, moral and socially conscientious person whostrives to help others.The one man plus two women recommendationmight be due to the statistical reflection of thegenerally recommended workplace for both genders.Though the Quran acknowledges and evenencourages women to have her independent savingsand income, women are biologically endowed withcertain qualities such as pregnancy and breastfeedingthat makes them the most suitable person to raisechildren. This in turn may create a statisticaldisadvantage regarding the number of womenfamiliar with the terminology of business contracts.Another reason for this one-man and two-womanarrangement could be the protection of women frombeing subjected to high pressure by the partybreaching the contract. The presence and support ofother women might reduce the pressure andpossibility of perjury. Modern authorization andconfirmation devices have reduced the need for livehuman witnesses.The extreme feminist agenda of ignoring such aquality and its benefits to children has harmed boththe family structure and the emotional developmentof millions of children. Despite their prosperous life,many children deprived of close attention of theirmothers are suffering from various emotional andmental problems, such as stress, attention deficiency,hyperactivity, and unhappiness.Instead of demanding respect and monetarycompensation for women's work at home, earlyfeminists bought the male chauvinist idea of belittlingwomen's traditional work, and tried to put women incompetition with men. The feminist assumption thatwomen are exactly equal to men and that they shouldcompete in every area of life and demonstratestatistical equality of accomplishments or failures inevery aspect of their lives has pushed women intoarenas that men are biologically advantageous in.Expecting equal performance is injustice both to menand women.From movies to children's stories, from the businessworld to politics we can witness discrimination onpar with the expectations of traditional sex roles.Using the female body as a commercial object, sexualharassment, rape, women battery, and sexist languageare endemic in our modern society. The feministmovement is an intelligent, but sometimes highlyemotional, protest of this unjust historical treatment.Men and women, in general, are different by nature,and have different needs and roles. However, somesex roles and inequalities are created by society andexploited by men. In order to let nature and justiceprevail over superficiality and injustice, it isimperative to have the following: 1) Equal respectand appreciation of roles regardless of their gender,2) Equal chance for both males and females to choosetheir roles freely and responsibly, And 3) Laws topromote and guarantee these two goals."

The verse about themutashabih (allegorical or multi-meaning) versesitself is mutashabih.

See [[2:106]];[[16:44]]; [[17:46]]; [[23:14]]; [[41:44]]; [[56:79]] for examples ofmultiple-meaning statements. Also, See [[39:23]].The word can be confusing for a novice. Verse [[39:23]],for instance, uses mutashabihat for the entire Quran,referring to its overall similarity -- in other words, itsconsistency. In a narrower sense, however,mutashabihat refers to all verses which can beunderstood in more than one way. The variousmeanings or implications require some specialqualities from the person listening to or reading theQuran: an attentive mind, a positive attitude,contextual perspective, the patience necessary forresearch, and so forth.It is one of the intriguing features of the Quran thatthe verse about mutashabih verses of the Quran isitself mutashabih -- that is, it has multiple meanings.The word in question, for instance, can mean\"similar\", as we have seen; it can mean, \"possessingmultiple meanings\"; it can also mean \"allegorical\"(where one single, clearly identifiable elementrepresents another single, clearly identifiableelement).As you may have noticed, interpretation of the lastpart of [[3:7]] depends on how one punctuates the verse.(There is no punctuation in the original Arabic text.)If one stops after the word \"God\", then one willassume, as centuries of Sunni and Shiite scholarshave, that even those who possess deep levels ofknowledge will never be able to understand the\"mutashabih\" verses. However, if the sentence doesnot stop there, the meaning will change to theopposite: Those who possess knowledge will be ableto understand the meaning of allegorical or multiple-meaning verses.

The expressions lailaha illa Allah (there is no god, but the god) and lailaha illa Hu (there is no god, but He) occur 30 timesin the Quran and never in conjunction with anothername. Trying a deficiency in the shahada taught byGod is a sign of not valuing God as He should bevalued. Requiring the addition of another name toGod's name implies that God forgot to includeMuhammad's name, thirty times ([[19:64]]; [[6:115]]).Trying to teach God is the zenith of ignorance andaudacity ([[49:16]]). Considering God alone insufficientis the symptom of idolatry ([[39:45]]).The only shahada (testimony) about themessengership of Muhammad is mentioned in verse[[63:1]], and those who feel the need for such atestimony are described as hypocrites. There aredifferent reasons for why a person might beconsidered a hypocrite while he or she is uttering theexpression ashadu anna Muhammadan rasululullah(I testify that Muhammad is a messenger of God).Today, the most common hypocrisy is that those whoutter this phrase in fact have considered Muhammadto be much more than a messenger, since they rejecthis message and messengership by not following theverses of the Quran and associating volumes offabricated narration and sectarian jurisprudence withit. Their testimony regarding Muhammad'smessengership is lip service, since they consider hima god by giving him the power of intercession, thepower of collaborating with God in decreeing rulesfor eternal salvation, the power of amending andabrogating God's law, the power of fabricatingprohibitions in the name of God, and the authority ofexplaining the \"ambiguous\" words in God's book.Despite the words of Muhammad's Lord, they do notconsider Muhammad a human being like them([[18:110]]; [[41:6]]). They do not believe what they saywhen they say \"Muhammad is God's servant\" sincethey consider the title \"messenger/mailman\" (rasul)of God to be an insult. They can utter God's namewithout phrases of praise, but they cannot utterMuhammad's name without words of praise.Ironically, they establish their custom of praisingMuhammad more than God through distorted andabused meanings of certain verses. Besides, theyviolate the clear Quranic instruction for notdiscriminating among His messengers; they putMuhammad in competition with other messengersand consider him high above other prophets andmessengers. In today's Sunni mosques, unlike themasjid of Muhammad's and his monotheistcompanions’ ([[72:18]]; [[20:14]]), you will find the namesof many idols smirking beside the name of God. Inaddition to Muhammad's name, one may find thenames of Abu Bakr, Omar, Osman, Ali, Hasan, andHusayn. The Shiites have their own set of idols andthey too adorn their mosques with their names.The list of ways Sunnis and Shiites idolizeMuhammad can fill an entire book. Nevertheless,they think that they are monotheists, as today'sTrinitarian Christians do. Religious leaders dupe theirfollowers by restricting the meaning of ‘idols’ topictures and statues; in fact, the idols duringMuhammad's time were abstract names and thosemushriks considered themselves to be monotheists([[53:19-28]]; [[6:22-24]]; [[6:148]]; [[16:35]]). One might ask,\"what about adorning the walls of masjids with anyof the four verses where Muhammad's name ismentioned?\" Well, what about hanging the versesabout paradise or hell? What about picking any of the136 verses where Moses' name is mentioned? Whatabout Jesus? Or, how about adorning the walls of themasjids with verses about the hypocrites andidolatry? Of course, there is no problem in hangingthe Quran upon the walls of masjids, but if aparticular verse is picked, then the intention orcontext becomes important. If any verse from theQuran should be picked, I suggest [[39:44]]/45 or [[39:11]]-12, or any other verse that reminds us to be righteousand helpful to other people. Also, See [[2:285]]; [[3:64]];[[39:45]]; [[53:23]]; [[72:18]].Numerous archeological evidences explain howdecades after the revelation of the Quran peopleadded Muhammad's name to the original shahada.For instance, see, the gold coin from Umayyad 90AH, or 80 years after the prophet's departure. Thougheighty years after Muhammad, those who workedhard to transform islam to Muhammadanism were notyet able to change the shahada (testimony), byadding side notes etc, they gradually replaced thecorrect Shahada with today's most common one, theone that mentions Muhammad's name after Allah.In the middle of one side of the coin, the expression,\"There is no God; He Alone; He has no partner\" isprominent. However, the falsifiers by now were ableto insert Muhammad's name in the margin by apatchy quotation from the end of verse [[48:28]] and thebeginning of [[48:29]], skipping the expression \"AndGod is sufficient as a witness.\" The expression\"Muhammadun Rasulullah\" (God's messengerMuhammad) is a fragment, not a statement, takenout of the context of verse [[48:29]]. They haveperformed an interesting surgery (deletion) in orderto be able to fit that fragment in the circle. The otherside of the coin contains some words from chapter112, emphasizing God's oneness and rejectingpartners. The Umayyad and Abbasid coins latermoved Muhammad's name to the center, next to God.This crucial distortion gradually took place in aperiod of time spanning several generations.See, for instance, the Old Testament, Deuteronomy[[5:1-11]]; [[6:4-6]]; 1 Samuel [[12:20-21]]; Psalms [[115:4-8]]."

Decades after the revelationof the Quran when muslims reverted back to the daysof ignorance, they started using this word literally to\"stone\" adulterers to death, or literally to \"stone\"Satan during Hajj. The Quran describes Satan withthe word RaJyM ([[3:36]]; [[15:17]]; [[15:34]]; [[16:98]]; [[38:77]];[[81:25]]). Nevertheless, Satan is not stoned but rejectedfrom heaven. Muslims, with the collection of hadithand creation of sects, about two centuries afterMuhammad, fully revived the pagan Arab traditions,borrowed superstitions, and backward practices fromthe distorted teachings of Christianity and Judaism.For instance, while they turned Muhammad's graveinto a shrine of idolatry and promoted its visitationamong the rituals of annual pilgrimage (Hajj), theyalso made a mockery of the phrase \"rejection ofSatan\" by innovating the practice of stoning theSatan, as if Satan was a material being. Every year,hundreds of people are injured or killed during themayhem caused by this absurd ritual.

Jesus is mentioned25 times while his mother Mary's name is mentioned34 times in the Quran. The Quran uses the name invarious combinations of title: Jesus; Jesus, son ofMary; Messiah; Messiah, Jesus, Son of Mary; andMessiah son of Mary. To emphasize his humannature, the Quran frequently refers to Jesus as \"Jesus,Son of Mary\" in 16 out of 25 occurrences of which 3are \"the Messiah, Jesus, and Son of Mary.\" TheQuran refers to Jesus as \"the Messiah, Son of Mary\"5 times, and \"Messiah\" 3 times.The Quran uses \"Son of Mary\" to refer to (J)esu(s) in21 out of 32 total references. The Gospel authors,however, influenced by the misogynistic teachings ofRabbis and the Pharisee-son-of-Pharisee St. Paul,never call their idols with the name of the womanwho gave birth to him. Actually, there might be anexception, Mark [[6:3]], which proves our point. Therethe \"son of Mary\" title is used by people who did notexpect from wonders from him. Obviously, theauthors of the Gospels and their guru St. Paulconsidered the title \"son of Mary\" to be demeaning.They transformed the original nickname \"son ofMary\" or \"the son of woman\" into \"the son of man,\"one of the oft-used Biblical attributes for Jesus.Gospel authors, however, did not stop there. Theymanaged to promote \"the son of man\" to \"the son ofGod,\" and from there one step higher, infinitelyhigher, to \"the only son of God,\" proving theingenuity of Satan to carve idols in many forms andshapes. If St. Paul had a miracle, his miracle wouldbe his contribution to the evolution of \"son of Mary\"to \"the only begotten son of God.\" In the case ofChristianity, Satan came up with a new formula,\"three gods in one,\" as well as many other saint-gods,and false teachings bonus, and plenty of guilt anddrama as incentive. Since then, the packagecontaining the formula has been a great success in thereligious market, where people act according to theirprimitive feelings rather than thoughts!Since the Pauline god is a character of fiction whosemajor deed is his suffering on crucifiction, it is theembodiment of contradiction. It not onlycontinuously oscillates between humanity anddivinity, but occasionally becomes a devil(Revelations [[22:16]] &amp; Isaiah [[14:12]]), accursed of God(Deuteronomy [[21:23]] &amp; Galatians [[3:13]] &amp; Matthew[[27:38]] &amp; Mark [[15:27]] &amp; Luke [[23:33]] &amp; John [[19:38]]),infinitely patient and curser of a fig tree (1 Timothy[[1:16]] v Matthew [[21:19]]), liar (John [[7:8-10]]), a very oldsheep (John [[1:29]] &amp; Exodus [[12:5]]), follower of thelaws and abolisher of the laws (Matthew [[5:17-19]] &amp;Luke [[16:17]] v Hebrews [[7:18-19]] &amp; Romans [[10:4]]),teller of everything and not teller of everything (John[[15:15]] v John [[16:12]]); the peacemaker and thewarmonger (John [[14:27]] &amp; Acts [[10:36]] &amp; Colossians[[1:19-20]] v Matthew [[10:34]]), a mighty authority and apowerless man (Colossians [[2:10]] v John [[5:30]]), part ofa trinity and part of a quadrinity (Matthew [[28:19]] vHebrews [[7:1-3]]), the last and not the last (Revelation[[22:13]] v John [[16:12-13]]), invisible and visible (John[[1:18]] v John [[18:20]]), and even one who ends up in hell(1 Peter [[3:18-20]] &amp; Matthew [[25:41]]).See the Quran: [[25:3]]; [[3:18]].

Itsoriginal version in Hebrew is Esau, a common Jewishname at the time. In classical times it was spelledYashua, and then it past through a series of mutationsending up with what we have now, Jesus, a WesternLatin hybrid. If it were not awkward, we wouldprefer writing the name as (J)esu(s). The same namecan be found as Hosea, Hoshea, Jehoshuah, Jeshua,Jeshuah, Osea and Oshea (See Strong's ExhaustiveConcordance of the Bible). These names arementioned hundreds of times in the Old Testament.They are all different spellings of the same originalexpression, meaning, \"Yahweh is salvation.\"However, Trinitarian Christians use and abuseMatthew [[1:1]] to create a human-god out oftransliterative inconsistencies: \"She will give birth toa son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, for hewill save his people from their sins.\" Besides, there ismore than one Christ (Anointed) in the Bible. Isaiah[[45:1]]; 1 Samuel [[24:6]], 10; 1Samuel [[26:9-23]]; Numbers[[3:3]] are but a few examples. The New Testamentrefers to the Son of Mary as \"Jesus of Nazareth\"(John [[18:7]]), and \"Jesus the son of Joseph\" (John [[6:42]]).Encyclopedia Americana, in its 1959 print, under theentry of Jesus provides the following information:\"Although Matthew [[1:21]] interprets the name(originally Joshua that is Yahweh is salvation) andfinds it especially appropriate for Jesus of Nazareth,it was a common one at the time. Josephus, theJewish historian, refers to 19 different persons by thatname.\" It is evident from St. Paul's letters, that theuse of the name continued among Christians for awhile (Colossians [[4:11]]). When St. Paul's polytheisticdoctrine became the official creed, Christians mostlyabandoned giving this name to their children. Withthe reputation of Jesus and the rise of Christianity,Jews too gave up using that name, since theyconsidered him a heretic, and the name of a new idol.Easton provides the following information about theword Jesus: \"This is the Greek form of the Hebrewname Joshua, which was originally Hoshea (Numbers[[13:8]], 16), but changed by Moses into Jehoshua(Numbers [[13:16]]; 1 Corinthians [[7:27]]), or Joshua.After the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whencethe Greek form Jesus.\""

For instance, the 19th centuryScottish Presbyterian scholar Easton provides thefollowing information on the verse: \"Through thesubtle temptation of the serpent she violated thecommandment of God by taking of the forbiddenfruit, which she gave also unto her husband(1Timothy [[2:13-15]]; 2Corinthians [[11:3]]).

    "r": {
      "2": "Polygamy is allowed only to providepsychological, social and economic support forwidows with orphans (See [[4:127]]). Muhammad'spractice of polygamy must have been in accordancewith the condition to serve an important socialservice. Sure, physical attraction of widows might beone of the factors for marriage and there is nothingwrong with that. Those who could afford practicingpolygamy, mentally and financially, should try hardto treat them equally, though [[4:129]] expresses thepractical impossibly of attaining that ideal.Additionally, the consent of the first wife isnecessary; otherwise, she can always seek divorce. Itis clear that polygamy is not an ideal form ofmarriage and an unusual practice allowed for difficulttimes, such as a dramatic reduction in the malepopulation during wartime. The age gap betweenmarrying men and women creates a surplus ofwomen who will never be able to find a monogamouspartner. By a strict prohibition on polygamy, millionsof young women are deprived from having alegitimate relationship with men. The only hope formillions of young girls is to get married with alreadydivorced men, perhaps with kids, or to have arelationship born out of promiscuous sexualpractices. The Western world does not prohibitpolygamy since many males have sexualrelationships with more than one woman at the sametime. The only thing that modern societies do isdeprive those women from the protection of law; theyare there to be used, disposed of and recycled bymen! The hypocrisy in the modern attitude becomesclear when homosexuality is defended on the pretextof \"consenting adults,\" but the same standards are notafforded to the polygamists. The conditionalpermission for polygamy is for the psychological andfinancial protection of children and their widowmothers, in cases of war or natural disaster.Polygamy, according to the Old Testament, startedwith the seventh generation after Cain and continuedas a common practice in the patriarchal age togetherwith having concubines (Genesis [[4:19]]; [[6:2]]; [[16:1-4]];[[22:21-24]]; [[28:8-9]]; [[29:23-30]], etc.). However, the OldTestament also disapproves of polygamy(Deuteronomy [[17:17]]).The Old Testament contains numerous exaggeratedstories. One is about the number of Solomon's wives.The roundness of the numbers of wives andconcubines and their total, the three numbers beingperfectly round, indicate an intentional exaggeration.\"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, andthree hundred concubines: and his wives turned awayhis heartâ (1 Kings [[11:3]]). It is highly plausible thatthe word \"hundred\" was inserted in the text by laterscribes to damage the reputation of Solomon forsome political agenda. The following verses depictSolomon as an evil person and idolater. The Quranneither accuses Solomon of indulging in a hedonisticsexual life nor of associating partners with God.Ironically, modern Christians are now bashingSolomon for not sticking to monogamy. To bepolitically correct, modern Christians do not hesitateto condemn the common practice of polygamyamong Jews and their prophets.Contrary to the Quran, which exhorts muslims to helpwidows, the misogynistic Rabbinical teachingsinserted into the Old Testament put them in thecategory of harlots, and finds them unworthy ofmarriage by the privileged class: priests (Leviticus[[21:14]]).The expression Ma malakat aymanukum has beentranslated by most translations as \"whom your righthands posses\" or \"captives\" or \"concubines.\" Wetranslated this and similar expressions found in[[4:3,24,25,36]]; [[16:71]]; [[23:6]]; [[24:31,33,58]]; [[30:28]];[[33:50,52,55]]; and [[70:30]], as \"those with whom youhave contractual rights.\" These were the wives of theenemy combatants who were persecuted because theyacknowledged the message of Islam and soughtasylum at the Muslim community ([[60:10]]). Since theydid not get through a normal divorce process, anexceptional contract allows them to marry muslims asfree women. Marrying them could create some social,economic and personal complications for thehusband. They have nothing to do with IBaD(slaves), as sectarian translations and commentariesstate. As we will learn, the Quran categoricallyrejects slavery and considers it to be the greatest sin(See [[3:79]]; [[4:25,92]]; [[5:89]]; [[8:67]]; [[24:32-33]]; [[58:3]]; [[90:13]];[[2:286]]; [[12:39-42]]; [[79:24]]). The practice of slavery wasjustified and resurrected to a certain extent via theinfluence of Jewish and Christian scholars, as well asfabricated hadith and sharia laws, decades afterMuhammad's departure.It is ironic that Jews who suffered the most fromslavery and were saved by God through theleadership of Moses (Exodus [[1:13-14]]), later justifiedenslaving other people, including selling one's owndaughter, and inserted that practice into their holybooks (Exodus [[21:7-8]]; [[21:21-22]]; 26-27; Leviticus[[25:44-46]]; Joshua [[9:6-27]]).Though Jesus never condoned slavery, St. Paul, thefounder of modern Christianity, once asked themasters to treat their slaves nicely (Colossians [[3:22]]),and asked the slaves to be \"submissive to yourmasters with all fear\" (1 Peter [[2:18]]; Ephesians [[6:5]]; 1Timothy [[6:2]]; Colossians [[3:22]]; Titus [[2:9]]) justifyingthe Marxist maxim, \"Religion is the opium ofmasses.\" The use of religion by the privileged class toenslave or exploit people is vividly depicted by theSouth African archbishop Desmond Tutu: \"When themissionaries came to Africa, they had the Bible andwe had the land. They said 'let us close our eyes andpray'. When we opened them, we had the Bible, andthey had the land.\"The word YaMYN means \"right hand\" ormetaphorically \"right,\" \"power\" or \"control.\"However, its plural form aYMaN is consistentlymentioned in the Quran to mean not \"right hands\" butto mean \"oaths\" or \"promises,\" implying the mutualnature of the relationship (See [[4:33]] [[5:89]]; [[9:12]]; [[16:91]]-94; [[2:224-225]]; [[30:28]]; [[66:2]]; [[5:53]]; [[6:109]]). This uniqueQuranic usage is similar to the semantic differencebetween the singular and plural forms of the wordAyat (signs) (see [[2:106]]).The expression in question, thus could be translatedas \"those whom your oaths/contracts have rightsover\" or \"those whom you hold rights through yourcontracts,\" or by reading aYMaN (oaths/contracts) asan object rather than a subject, \"those whohold/possess your contracts.\"The marriage declaration is a mutual partnershipbetween two sexes and is formed by participation offamily members. A married woman cannot marryanother man without getting divorced from herhusband. However, if a woman escapes and joinsmuslims while her husband stayed behindparticipating in a war against muslims, she maymarry a Muslim man without actually gettingdivorced from her combatant husband; she willlegally be considered a divorcee ([[60:10]]). Since thiscontract is different from the normal marriagecontract, this special relationship is described indifferent words. The same is valid for a man whosewife allies with the hostile enemy. See [[24:31]] and[[33:55]]. Those who work for another person accordingto employment contracts are also referred to with thesame expression. See [[16:71]]; [[30:28]]. Also, see [[4:25,36]];[[23:6]]; [[24:58]]; [[33:50]]; [[33:52]]; [[70:30]].The Quran does not demand those who lived togetherbased on a mutual promise (AYMaN) during the daysof ignorance, without a marriage contract, to getdivorced. Similarly, it does not want those whomarried two sisters before accepting islam to be away of life ([[4:23]]). This tolerance does not encourageliving together without marriage. It only does notwant to incur further damage to the family structureand does not want to create hurdles for those whowish to live according to the principles of islam."

It isimportant to remember that the ratio of sharesinstructed by the Quran to each other is as importantas their ratio to the whole. In brief, the fractions arecompared both to the whole and to each other. Adeceased person might leave behind hundreds ofcombinations of relatives, father or no father, motheror no mother, son or no son, one son or more sons,daughter or no daughter, one daughter or moredaughters, brother or no brother, one brother or morebrothers, sister or no sister, one sister or more sisters,and numerous combinations among them. If theQuran suggested the fractions as merely their ratiocompared to the whole inheritance, since for eachcombination of inheritors the ratios too would need tobe changed, we would need hundreds of versesdetailing the ratio for each combination. However,when we comprehend that the ratio in suggesteddistributions also reflect the amount of inheritance inproportion to each other, the verses about inheritancecan easily be understood and implemented.For instance, let us assume that after deducting thedebt and other shares, a man left a 50 thousand dollarinheritance to his wife and father without speciallyallocating the shares. Their shares should be 1/4th and1/6th, respectively. Thus, the formula would be(1/4)+(1/6)=50,000. If we find the commondenominator, then we see the ratio of inheritance asmuch clearer. When we take the commondenominator, the numerator start to make sense incomparison to the share of each inheritor and to theinheritance: (3/12)+(2/12)=50,000. That means, thewife receives $30,000 and the father receives $20,000of the inheritance. In sum, to learn the default sharesof inheritors the fractions indicating the shares areadded up and equated to the inheritance. Let's assumethat we are asked to distribute 19 gold pieces amongtwo people; one will receive 1/5th and the other 1/3rd.<br>(k1 + k2 + ... + kn) . x = t <br>pn = kn . x<br>k1 = 1/5 <br>k2 = 1/3 <br>(1/3 + 1/5) . x = 19 ? x = 19 . 15 / 8 <br>p1 = (1/5) . 19 . 15 / 8 ? p1= 7 + 1/8 <br>p2 = (1/3) . 19 . 15 / 8 ? p2= 11 + 7/8<br>The Old Testament does deprive daughters ofinheritance from their parents and favors the firstborn against other children.

      "14": "As I discussed extensively, in TÃ¼rkÃ§e KuranÃevirilerindeki Hatalar (Errors in TurkishTranslation of the Quran, Istanbul, 1992-1998) andin English article, Beating Women or Beating Aroundthe Bush (Unorthodox Articles, Internet, 1998), fourkey words or phrases have been mistranslated bytraditional translators. To justify the misogynistic andpatriarchal practices, deliberately or unknowingly, amajority of translators render the phrase kawamunaala al-nisa as \"in charge of women\" rather than\"providers for women\" or \"observant of women.\"Interestingly, the same translators translate the sameverb mentioned in [[4:135]]; [[5:8]]; [[4:127]]; [[2:229]]; [[20:14]];[[55:9]] as \"observe/maintain.\" When the same verb isused to depict a relationship between man andwoman, it somehow magically transforms into aprescription of hierarchy and authority.The second key word that is commonly mistranslatedis iDRiBuhunna. In almost all translations, you willsee it translated as \"scourge,\" or \"beat\" or \"beat(lightly)\". The verb DaRaBa is a multiple-meaningverb akin to English ‘strike’ or ‘get.’ The Quran usesthe same verb with various meanings, such as, totravel, to get out ([[3:156]]; [[4:101]]; [[38:44]]; [[73:20]]; [[2:273]]),to strike ([[2:60,73]]; [[7:160]]; [[8:12]]; [[20:77]]; [[24:31]]; [[26:63]];[[37:93]]; [[47:4]]), to beat ([[8:50]]), to beat or regret ([[47:27]]),to set up ([[43:58]]; [[57:13]]), to give (examples)([[14:24,45]]; [[16:75,76,112]]; [[18:32,45]]; [[24:35]]; [[30:28,58]];[[36:78]]; [[39:27,29]]; [[43:17]]; [[59:21]]; [[66:10,11]]), to takeaway, to ignore ([[43:5]]), to condemn ([[2:61]]), to seal, todraw over ([[18:11]]), to cover ([[24:31]]), and to explain([[13:17]]). It is again interesting that the scholars pickthe meaning BEAT, among the many otheralternatives, when the relationship between man andwoman is involved, a relationship that is defined bythe Quran with mutual love and care ([[30:21]]).The third word that has been traditionallymistranslated is the word NuSHuZ as \"rebellion\" or\"disobedience\" or \"opposition\" to men. If we study[[4:34]] carefully we will find a clue that leads us totranslate that word as embracing a range of relatedideas, from \"flirting\" to \"engaging in an extramaritalaffair\" â indeed, any word or words that reflects therange of disloyalty in marriage. The clue is the phrasebefore nushuz, which reads: \". . . they honor themaccording to God's commandments, even when alonein their privacy.\" This phrase emphasizes theimportance of loyalty in marital life, and helps us tomake better sense of what follows. Interestingly, thesame word, nushuz, is used later in the same chapter,in [[4:128]] â but it is used to describe the misbehaviorof husbands, not wives, as it was in [[4:34]]. In our view,the traditional translation of nushuz, that is,\"opposition,\" will not fit in both contexts. However,the understanding of nushuz as marital disloyalty, in avariety of forms, is clearly appropriate for both [[4:34]]and [[4:128]].The fourth word is the word QaNiTat, which means\"devoted to God,\" and in some verses it describesboth man and woman ([[2:116,238]]; [[3:17,43]]; [[16:120]];[[30:26]]; [[33:31,35]]; [[39:9]]; [[66:5,12]]). Though this word ismostly translated correctly as \"obedient,\" when readin the context of the above-mentioned distortion itconveys a false message as if to imply that womenmust be \"obedient\" to their husbands as their inferior,while the word refers to obedience to God's law. Theword is mentioned as a general description of Muslimwomen ([[66:12]]), and more interestingly thedescription of Mary who, according to the Quran, didnot even have a husband! ([[66:12]]).The traditional distortion of this verse was firstquestioned by Edip Yuksel in his book, \"KuranÃevirilerindeki Hatalar\" (Errors in TurkishTranslations) (1992, Istanbul). For a detaileddiscussion on verse [[4:34]], see the SampleComparisons section in the Introduction.After the revelation of the Quran, Muslim scholarsturned back to the days of ignorance and they weresupported by some Jewish and Christian scholarswho apparently converted to Islam yet did notexperience a paradigm change. These semi-convertsand those Arabs who longed for the old culture ofignorance combined their forces together to take backthe rights of women recognized and promoted by theQuran. The rights of women in the West have beenrecognized through the separation of church andstate; however the culture is still basically a maledominant one and thus western women areobjectified and exploited tremendously in thebusiness world. The western culture is deeplyinfluenced by the teaching of Christianity originatingfrom the misogynistic authors of Old Testament andSt. Paul (not Jesus) who subordinates women to men.For instance, see Ephesians [[5:22-33]]; Colossians [[3:18]]-19; 1 Peter [[3:1-7]].\"Let your women keep silent in the churches, for theyare not permitted to speak; but they are to besubmissive, as the law also says\" (I Corinthians 14:34). \"For a woman is not covered, let her also beshorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shornor shaved, let her be covered. For a man indeed oughtnot to cover his head, since he is the image and gloryof God; but woman is the glory of man. For man isnot from woman, but woman from man. Nor wasman created for the woman, but woman for the man\"(I Corinthians [[11:6-9]]). \"Let a women learn in silencewith all submission. And do not permit a woman toteach or to have authority over a man, but to be insilence. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. AndAdam was not deceived, but the woman beingdeceived, fell into transgression. Nevertheless, shewill be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith,love and holiness, with self-control\" (I Timothy [[2:11]]-15).St. Paul's misogynistic teaching is a reflection andextension of a historical trend. The Old Testamentcontains many man-made misogynist teachings. Forinstance, a woman is considered unclean for oneweek if she gives birth to a son, but unclean for twoweeks if she gives birth to a daughter (Leviticus [[12:1]]-5).The Quran prohibits a sexual relationship with amenstruating woman, not because she is dirty, butbecause menstruation is painful ([[2:222]]). The purposeis to protect women's health from being burdened bythe sexual desires of their husbands. However, themale authors of the Old Testament, exaggerated andgeneralized this divine prohibition so much so thatthey turned menstruation into a reason for a woman’shumiliation, isolation, and punishment (Leviticus[[15:19-33]]).Christianity puts all the blame on the shoulders ofwomen for the troubles in this world. Yet, accordingto the Quran, we are created from one person (nafs),not one man ([[4:1]]). Furthermore, it was not Eve, but itwas both Adam and his spouse who were deceived inthe Paradise ([[2:30-39]]; [[7:19-27]]).The Old Testament contains hyperbolicexaggerations and bizarre practices. For someexamples, See the footnote of [[4:119]]."

Our Lord informs a Muslim who isdoing wrong to himself or herself by consumingalcohol not to commit additional disrespect to God byaddressing God in a drunken state of mind.Additionally, this verse indirectly gives permission tothe community to not to allow their intoxicatedbrothers and sisters into the places of prostration.Another lesson derived from this commandment isthat we should know what we are saying or recitingduring our prayers. Reciting Arabic words withoutknowing their meanings is like praying whileintoxicated. See [[2:106]]; [[4:82]].Bleeding, passing gas, or shaking hands with womenand other reasons mentioned in hadith and sectarianbooks, do not void the ablution. Despite this clearverse, Sunni and Shiite sects contain manycontradictory rules about ablution.

Let us briefly discuss thisexample to see better the nature of abuse, and howthousands of hadith rabbits are produced from emptyhats. Obeying Bukhari, a narrator of hearsay, is notobeying the messenger. Obeying the messenger isobeying the complete, perfect and fully detailedQuran.

They do not think that Muhammadpracticed the Quran, and the Quran alone ([[5:48]], 49).They do not hear Muhammad's only complaint abouthis people ([[25:30]]). They do not understand thatMuhammad disowns those who do not understandthat the Quran is enough and fully detailed ([[6:114]]).The first verse of Chapter 9 states that an ultimatumis issued from God and His messenger. Muslimsacknowledge that verses about the ultimatum areentirely from God. God did not consult Muhammadabout the ultimatum. Muhammad's only mission wasto deliver God's message ([[16:35]]; [[24:54]]). Thus, thereason that God included the messenger in [[9:1]] is notbecause he was another authority in issuing it, butbecause he participated as the deliverer of theultimatum. Similarly, because people receive God'smessage through messengers, we are ordered to obeythe messengers.

The Quran will stand out as a book that doesnot contain any falsehood.The Quranic description of the earth, the solarsystem, the cosmos and the origin of the universe iscenturies ahead of the time of its first revelation. Forinstance, the Quran, delivered in the seventh centuryC.E., states or implies that: Time is relative ([[32:5]];[[70:4]]; [[22:47]]). God created the universe from nothing([[2:117]]). The earth and heavenly bodies were once asingle point and they were separated from each other([[21:30]]). The universe is continuously expanding([[51:47]]). The universe was created in six days (stages)and the conditions that made life possible on earthtook place in the last four stages ([[50:38]]; [[41:10]]). Thestage before the creation of the earth is described as agas nebula ([[41:11]]). Planet earth is floating in an orbit([[27:88]]; [[21:33]]; [[36:40]]). The earth is round ([[10:24]];[[39:5]]; [[55:33]]) and resembles an egg ([[10:24]]; [[39:5]];[[79:30]]). The universe is also round ([[55:33]]). Oceanshave subsurface wave patterns ([[24:40]]). Earth'satmosphere acts like a protective shield ([[21:32]]).Wind also pollinates plants ([[15:22]]). The bee hasmultiple stomachs ([[16:69]]). The workers in honeybeecommunities are females ([[16:68-69]]). After years ofdisappearance, Periodical Cicadas emerge alltogether with a cacophony of songs, testifying asimilitude of resurrection for those who appreciateGod's signs in the nature ([[54:7]]). The creation ofliving creatures follows an evolutionary system([[7:69]]; [[15:28-29]]; [[24:45]]; [[32:7-9]]; [[71:14-17]]). Theearliest biological creatures were incubated insideflexible layers of clay ([[15:26]]). The stages of humandevelopment in the womb are detailed ([[23:14]]). Ourbiological life span is coded in our genes ([[35:11]]).Photosynthesis is a recreation of energy storedthrough chlorophyll ([[36:77-81]]). Everything is createdin pairs ([[13:3]]; [[51:49]]; [[36:36]]). The atomic number,atomic weight and isotopes of Iron are specified([[57:25]]). Atoms of elements found on earth contain amaximum of seven energy layers ([[65:12]]). There willbe new and better transportation vehicles beyondwhat we know ([[16:8]]). The edges of land, that isshores, will be reduced in size because of human'sreckless behavior ([[13:41]]). The sound and vision ofwater and the action of eating dates (which containoxytocin) reduce labor pains ([[19:24-25]]). There is life(not necessarily intelligent) beyond earth ([[42:29]]).The Quran correctly refers to Egypt's ruler who madeJoseph his chief adviser as king (malik), not asPharaoh ([[12:54]]). Many of the miracles mentioned inthe Quran, for instance, represent the ultimate goalsof science and technology. The Quran relates thatmatter (but not humans) can be transported at thespeed of light ([[27:30-40]]); that smell can betransported to remote places ([[12:94]]); that extensivecommunication with animals is possible ([[27:16-17]]);that sleep, in certain conditions, can slow downmetabolism and increase life spans ([[18:25]]); and thatthe vision of blind people can be restored ([[3:49]]). Thenumber of months in a year is stated as 12 and theword Month (shahr) is used exactly twelve times.The number of days in a year is not stated, but theword Day (yawm) is used exactly 365 times. Thefrequency of the word year (sana) in its singular formoccurs 7 times and plural form 12 times and together19 times; each number relating to an astronomicevent. A prophetic mathematical structure based onthe number 19 implied in chapter 74 of the Quranwas discovered in 1974 by the aid of computersshows that the Quran is embedded with aninterlocking extraordinary mathematical system,which was also discovered in the original parts of theOld Testament in the 11th century. And there's more âmuch more. See [[68:1]]; [[79:30]]; [[74:1-37]]. Also seeAppendix titled: There is No Contradiction in theQuran."

For instance, Ahmed B.Hanbal in his Musnad reports that Usman bin el-Asrefused to participate in a circumcision ceremony,since he considered circumcision an innovation. TheSunni historian Taberi reports that Caliph Abd al-Aziz rejected the suggestion of his advisors that thepeople of Khurasan should be circumcised; they wereconverted to \"Islam\" to avoid paying extra tax!Bukhari gives contradictory numbers for the yearAbraham was allegedly circumcised, 80 versus 120.Bukhari who reports hearsay regarding thecircumcision of converts and women, also reportsthat when Greeks and Abyssinians embraced islamthey were not examined at all by Muhammad.Hadith books, including Bukhari, contain numeroushadiths promoting circumcision including femalecircumcision, which is a torturous mutilation.However, hadith fabricators somehow forgot tofabricate hadiths about the circumcision of prominentfigures during the time of Muhammad. Moreinterestingly, since the practice of circumcision wasadopted centuries later, they missed the opportunityto attribute this practice to Muhammad himself.Sunni scholars, therefore, came up with another so-called miracle: Muhammad was born circumcised.This would answer those who wondered about theabsence of such an \"important\" record in the books ofhadith and sunna.The Quran never mentions Abraham practicingcircumcision. If indeed Abraham did such a surgeryon himself, perhaps he wanted to eliminate some kindof infection, and the blind followers who lateridolized him turned his personal deed into a religiousritual. Looking at the history of the Jewish peopleand their trials and tribulations, it is more likely thatthis is an invention of Rabbis to mark the endangeredrace and protect it from extinction. Introducinginnovations in religious communities may need some\"holy stories\" to attribute the innovation to historicalidols.The Quran never mentions the adventures of theBiblical character Samson who had a bizarre hobbyof collecting the foreskins of the thousands of peoplehe killed by the jaw of an ass (Old Testament Judges[[15:16]]).The Old Testament contains hyperbolicexaggerations and bizarre practices. For instance,ignoring the discrepancy in the number of mutilatedpenises read the following verses from Bible:\"So David rose and he and his men went and struckdown among the Philistines two hundred men, andDavid came bringing their foreskins and giving themin full number to the king, to form a marriage alliancewith the king. In turn Saul gave him Michal, hisdaughter, as a wife.\" (1 Samuel [[18:27]]).\"Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son ofSaul, demanding, 'Give me my wife Michal, whom Iengaged to myself for a hundred foreskins of thePhilistines\" (2 Samuel [[3:14]]).Using a bundle of foreskins of mutilated genitals ofthe dead bodies of enemy as the symbolic show ofmanhood, and literally using them in exchange for awoman is appalling and insulting to women.Samson's obsession and adventure with Philistinegirls is similarly strange (Judges 14). When Samsonis betrayed by his wife, Timnah, or his heifer (Judges[[14:18]]!), he loses the bet during the seven days of thefeast. This time thirty men from Ashkelon have tolose their lives. Later, Samson torches Philistine grainfields with torches tied to the tails of foxes; kills athousand Philistines with a \"donkey's jawbone,\" andprays to God not to let him die in the hands of the\"uncircumcised\" (Judges [[15:15-16]]). This Biblicalhero, in his bloody pursuit of another wife, spends anight with a prostitute (Judges [[16:1]]) and later anotherwife, Delilah, by shaving his hair, the source of hisextraordinary power, betrays him (Jud [[16:18-20]]).Samson dies after killing more Philistines. The storycan be outlined in a few words: Marriage, Feast,Foreskins, Slaughtering, Torching, Betraying, Heifer,Prostitute, Superstition, Killing, and Killing more!Muslims, long after the revelation of the Quran anddeparture of Muhammad, acquired from Jews thebizarre obsession with hair and foreskins! If someoneconverts to the Sunni or Shiite religions, one of thefirst troubles he finds himself in is to undergo a smallsurgery on the foreskin of his penis and a holyrecommendation to grow a long beard. Additionally,he will exchange his original name with an Arabicone! This marks just the beginning of becoming aJewish Arab who follows a concocted culture fromthe medieval ages."

The mistranslation isso obvious, that it is curious how those who hadknowledge of Arabic did not notice it. Unfortunately,this mistranslation helped the justification ofmarrying girls at a very young age.Though the Quran permits polygamy to men ([[4:3]]), itstrictly discourages its actual practice by requiringcertain significant preconditions: men may marrymore than one wife only if the later ones are widowswith children, and they should treat each wife equallyand fairly (See [[4:19-20]]; 127-129.) Unfortunately,verse [[4:127]] has been traditionally misinterpreted andmistranslated in such a way as to suggest that Godpermits marriage with juvenile orphans. This isclearly not the case.The Arabic expression yatam al-nisa illati in [[4:127]]has been routinely mistranslated as \"women orphans,whom...\" The expression is also sometimes translatedas \"orphans of women whom...\" This latertranslation, though accurate, makes the crucialreference of the objective pronoun \"whom\"ambiguous: Does the phrase after \"whom\" describeorphans or women?As it happens, the Arabic plural pronoun in this verseis the female form, allaty (not the male formallazyna), and it can only refer to the women justreferenced, not to the orphans. This is because theArabic word yatama (orphans) is grammatically malein gender!All the English translations of the Quran that we haveseen have mistranslated this passage. This isremarkable, because the correct translation requiresonly an elementary knowledge of Arabic grammar.This error is thus much more than a simplegrammatical slip; it is, we would argue, willfulmisrepresentation. The traditional interpretation ofthis passage offers an apparent justification formarriage with children, which flatly contradicts theQuran.Like so many passages in the Quran, [[4:127]]'s meaningwas severely distorted in order to gain the favor ofrich, dominant males.

Any aggressive behavior against those peopleis against God's law that recognizes freedom ofchoice, opinion and their expression ([[2:256]]; [[4:90]];[[4:140]]; [[10:99]]; [[18:29]]; [[25:63]]; [[88:21,22]]. Also see[[28:54]]). In verse [[4:140]], the Quran recommends us toprotest passively those who indulge in mockery ofour faith by leaving their presence. Furthermore, itrecommends us not to cut our relationship with them;we should turn back in peace and continue ourdialogue when they come to their senses and are ableto engage in a rational discourse.Those who react with violence against those whoinsult the tenets and principles of islam, are notfollowing the very system they claim to defend. TheQuran does not recognize the \"fighting words\"exception recognized by Western jurisprudence.Specific false accusation against a person, however,is not included in expression of opinion, since it isdefamation and it can harm a person in many ways.Insult to someone's values or heroes, however, onlyharms the person who indulges in such an ignorantand arrogant action.The only unforgivable sin, according the Quran is thesin of associating other partners/idols with God. Godallows this biggest sin to be committed in this world.He fulfills his promise to test humans by giving themfree choice. He condemns those who deprive othersfrom exercising that freedom of choice. Who then, inthe name of the same God, can force others from anyexpression of their belief or disbelief?In contrast to what the warmongering Crusaders,Sunnis and Shiites wish to portray, Muhammad wasnot a man of violence but a man of reason and peace.Numerous verses of the Quran and a critical study ofhistory will reveal that the portrait of Muhammaddepicted in Sunni or Shiite hearsay books is fictional;a fiction created by the propagandists of rulers of theUmayyad and Abbasid dynasties to justify theiratrocities and aggression! He and his supporters werethreatened and tortured in Mecca for their criticism oftheir corrupt and unjust theocratic system. They wereforced to leave everything behind and emigrate toYathrib (today's Medina). There they established apeaceful city-state, a federal secular democracy,among its multi-religious diverse citizens.Nevertheless, the Meccan oligarchy did not leavethem alone to enjoy peace and freedom; theyorganized several major war campaigns against thecoalition of muslims, Christians, Jews and Pagansunited under the leadership of Muhammad. In all thewars, including Uhud, Badr, and Handaq (Trenches),the monotheist reformers fought for self-defense.They even dug trenches around the city to defendthemselves from the aggressive religious coalition ledby Mecca's theocratic oligarchy. Muhammad'smessage, which promoted reason, freedom, peace,justice, unity of children of Adam, appreciation ofdiversity, rights of women and slaves, and socialconsciousness, soon received acceptance by themasses in the land. Yet, after ten years in exile, whenMuhammad and his supporters finally returned toMecca as victors, he declared amnesty for all thoseoppressors and warmongers who inflicted on themgreat suffering, who maimed and murdered many oftheir comrades, all because the muslims hadquestioned the teachings and culture they inheritedfrom their parents. However, guided by the teachingsof the Quran, Muhammad chose forgiveness andpeace; he did not punish any of his bloody enemies.After all, he was one of the many messengers ofislam, peace and submission to God alone."

      "49": "Millions of Christians believe in the \"HolyTrinity\" on faith. Through this formula, theytransformed Jesus, the son of Mary, into the \"Son ofGod\", and even God himself. However, history,logic, arithmetic, the Old Testament, and the NewTestament prove the contrary: Jesus was not Lord; hewas a creation of God like Adam was.The doctrine of the Trinity is found in many paganreligions. Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu are theTrinitarian godhead in Indian religions. In Egyptthere was the triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus; inBabylon, Ishtar, Sin, Shamash; in Arabia, Al-Laat,Al-Uzza, and Manat. The Encyclopedia Britannica(1975) gives a critical piece of information:\"Trinity, the doctrine of God taught by Christians thatasserts that God is one in essence but three in'person,' Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Neither theword Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such,appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and hisfollowers intend to contradict the scheme in the OldTestament: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is oneLord' (Deuteronomy 6: 4)\"This information on the Trinity contradicts the faithof most Christians. They believe that Matthew [[28:19]]and John[[1:1]] and some other verses clearly provide abasis for the doctrine of the Trinity. However, theNew Catholic Encyclopedia (1967 edition, Vol: 14, p.306) acknowledges that the Trinity doctrine does notexist in the Old Testament, and that it was formulatedthree centuries after Jesus. The Athanasian Creedformulated a polytheistic doctrine with the followingwords: \"We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinityin Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nordividing the Substance (Prayer Book, 1662). TheFather is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit isGod, and yet there are not three Gods but one God.\"It is unanimously accepted that the doctrine of theTrinity is the product of the Nicene Conference (325AC). The renowned Christian commentator Eastonexplains Trinity in one paragraph:\"Trinity: a word not found in Scripture, but used toexpress the doctrine of the unity of God as subsistingin three distinct Persons. This word is derived fromthe Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by Tertullian(A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositionsinvolved in the doctrine are these: 1. That God is one,and that there is but one God (De [[6:4]]; 1Ki [[8:60]]; Isa[[44:6]]; Mr [[12:29,32]]; Joh [[10:30]]). 2. That the Father is adistinct divine Person (hypostasis, subsistentia,persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct from theSon and the Holy Spirit. 3. That Jesus Christ wastruly God, and yet was a Person distinct from theFather and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit isalso a distinct divine Person.\"Questions such as, \"How could the Father, the Son,and the Holy Spirit be totally different and yetparticipate in the one undivided nature of God?\" havegiven Christian scholars a hard time for centuries. Toexplain the nature of the Trinity, they have writtenvolumes of books full of interpretations andspeculations ending up with a divine paradox, or adivine mystery, which amount to no more than holygobbledygook. So, it is not worthwhile to questionthe meaning of the Trinity further as the answer,ultimately, will be that it is a divine mystery whichcannot be understood. Instead, we will question thecompatibility of the doctrine with the Bible.The Trinity is not taught in any of the thirty-ninebooks of the Old Testament. None of the Biblicalprophets, such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Davidmention the Trinity. To the contrary, theyemphasized God's oneness (Deuteronomy 4: 39; 6: 4;32: 39. Exodus 20: 2-3. 1 Samuel 2: 2. 1 Kings 8: 60,Isaiah 42: 8; 45: 5-6).The concept of the Trinity was fabricated withinseveral centuries through gradual distortion andgradual exaggeration of the powers of the hero.Initially, there were many Christian communitiesrejecting the idea of the deity of Jesus, such as theEbonites, but ultimately, the followers of St. Paulwere victorious against the true supporters of Jesus,and they used force, occasionally in a very cruel way,to impose their authority.The Bible contains many verses rejecting the doctrineof the Trinity. For instance, according to the Bible,we all can become the children of God, that is, thefollowers of God, thereby contradicting the idea thatJesus was the only one (Matthew [[5:9]]; [[6:14]], Luke[[20:36]]; John [[8:47]], 1 John [[5:18,19]]). According to theBible, Jesus rebukes someone calling him \"Good,\" byasking him rhetorically, \"Why do you call me good?\"and then answering the question, \"Only God is trulygood!\" (Mark [[10:18-19]]). Furthermore, to those whoasked about the time of the end of the world, Jesusrejected the concept of the Trinity, which equatesGod with Jesus: \"No one knows about that day orhour, not even the angels in heaven, nor I myself, but,only the Father.\" (Mark [[13:32]]) If Jesus were Lord, asSt. Paul's followers assert, how could he not know thefuture? Many verses in the Gospel reject the conceptof the deity of Jesus and promote strict monotheism.\"Jesus replied, 'The one that says, 'Hear, O Israel!The Lord our God is the one and only God. And youmust love him with all your heart and soul and mindand strength.'\" (Mark [[12:29]]). Also, see [[4:10]]; [[6:24]],Mark [[10:18]], Luke [[18:19]].Another verse quoting from the Old Testamentdepicts Jesus as a Servant of God (Matthew [[12:17]]-18). Isn't there a difference between God and theServant of God? The polytheist Christians will find itvery difficult to answer this simple question and theywill seek refuge in their dark cave called \"mystery.\"They will do anything to continue their belief in thefabricated doctrine of the \"Pharisee-son-of-a-Pharisee\" as their prime holy teaching (Matthew[[16:11-12]]; [[23:13-33]]; Luke [[12:1-2]]; Acts [[23:6]]). Jesus,according to the Gospels, was a \"messenger of God\"(Matthew [[21:11,46]]; Luke [[7:16]]; [[24:19]]; John [[4:19]];[[6:14]]), yet to Jesus-worshipping polytheists there isnot much difference between the \"messenger of God\"and \"God.\" If you bring them a dictionary anddemand some rational justification, you will hit thewall of \"mystery.\" In St. Paul’s Wonderland, Biblicalwords either do not have much meaning, or theymutate and transform in many incredible ways.Whether Jesus saw God or not, might be anotherimportant questing in refuting the Trinity, but verseJohn [[1:18]] provides two contradictory answers in twodifferent versions.The Trinity is not a logical or rational theory; itsabsurdity can be expressed in mathematical terms as1=1+1+1. Although it is logically and mathematicallyfalse, it survives in the imaginations of people whohave faith in the wishful thinking of idolizedclergymen. One may find hundreds of Biblical versesrejecting the deity of Jesus and still be unable toconvince a Christian inflicted with this virus. Thedoctrine is based on revering and consecrating a clearlogical contradiction: A being who was a creature, ahuman being, and at the same time a non-humanbeing, a creator, the creator! It ignores the fact thatnothing can be both a man and a God, according tothe very definition of the word \"man\" and \"God.\"God is not created, but man is created; God does notneed food, but man does; God is eternal, but man ismortal; the eternal cannot be mortal. So on and soforth. The First Cause, or the uncreated cannot be, atthe same time, created.Therefore, the doctrine of the Trinity is a virus thatattacks and destroys the immunity system of the brainfirst. A person who received such a virus \"on faith,\"by blindly following the teaching of a particularchurch or the proximate crowd, will not be healed bythe rules of logic, mathematics, history, archeologicalfindings, or scientific evidence. Nothing can soberthem up from their intoxication. The virus is madeeven more invincible by the first planter of the seedof this virus, Paul, who boasted to his \"flock\" that hebecomes everything and anything, all things to allmen just to win them over(1 Corinthians [[9:20-22]]):\"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach anyother gospel to you than what we have preached toyou, let him be accursed. As we have said before, sonow I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospelto you than what you have received, let him beaccursed.\" (Galatians [[1:8-9]]).No wonder, the idol-carver Pharisee-the-son-of-a-Pharisee has plenty of contempt for those whoreason, and wrote the most impressive eulogy forfoolishness and packaged it as part of the \"gospel\"together with an invincible bug against reason,evidence, and even God's angels. Tertullian, the onewho gave birth to the doctrine of the Trinity, wroteone of the fanciest defenses for dogmatism, bigotryand narrow-mindedness, that later gave fruit toindulgences, inquisition, witch-hunts, crusades, andmany other tragedies. Tertullian tried to banishreason through lousy reasoning:\"These are human and demonic doctrines,engendered for itching ears by the ingenuity of thatworldly wisdom which the Lord called foolishness,choosing the foolish things of the world to putphilosophy to shame. For worldly wisdom culminatesin philosophy with its rash interpretation of God'snature and purpose. It is philosophy that supplies theheresies with their equipmentâ¦ After Jesus Christwe have no need of speculation, after the Gospel noneed of research. When we come to believe, we haveno desire to believe anything else; for we begin bybelieving that there is nothing else which we have tobelieve.\"Ironically, a handful of verses are abused to justifythe Trinity, and ALL of them are questionable. Forinstance, many Christian scholars acknowledge thatthe crucial word, \"only begotten\" in John [[1:14,18]] andJohn [[3:16,18]] does not exist in the originalmanuscripts. The phrase \"son of God,\" throughvarious versions, and translation of translationsmutated into \"the only begotten Son of God.\" Thedifference in the number of words is small, but intheology, the difference is as big as the differencebetween monotheism and polytheism.Many Western theologians and historians have cometo the conclusion that today's Christianity is theproduct of St. Paul, not (J)esu(s).

In [[13:4]], the nounform is used to describe \"pieces,\" and its usage in[[69:46]] is understood by some scholars to be physicaltoo. The derivatives that are read in the QaTTaa formoccur 17 times. This form, which expresses intensityor frequency of the action, is used both to meanphysical cutting off ([[5:33]]; [[7:124]]; [[20:71]]; [[26:49]];[[13:31]]) and metaphorical cutting off ([[2:166]]; [[6:94]];[[7:160]]; [[7:167]]; [[9:110]]; [[47:15]]; [[47:22]]; [[21:93]]; [[22:19]];[[23:53]]) as well as physically cutting or markingsomething ([[12:31]]; [[12:50]]).Verse [[12:31]] mentions women gathered for a partycutting their fingers with knives, for they were awedby the physical attraction of Joseph. Obviously, thosewomen did not cut off their fingers. Thus, it ispossible to understand the punishment for thieves inthree alternative ways, (1) cutting off their hands, or(2) cutting or marking their hands, or (3) cutting theirmeans to steal, or cutting their hands fromcommitting the crime. It is up to the society to chooseone of these meanings or a combination of themdepending on the severity of the crime (See [[7:52]]).It is not right to see theft merely as an individualcrime. Family structures, social norms, economicsystems, social institutions and values are alsoresponsible for this crime. A society might reduce thecrime of theft and burglary by increasing the strengthof the family structure and ties, by establishing socialand charity institutions, prohibiting usury, changingtheir wasteful lifestyle, and distributing wealth in away that is more egalitarian. Punishment alone is notthe right way to fight crimes; preventive measuresneed to be taken. For a discussion of this verse, seethe Sample Comparisons section in the Introduction.According to the Bible, thieves were punished bypunitive restitution (Exodus [[22:1-8]]; 2 Samuel [[12:6]]).If the thief could not pay the fine, he was to be soldto a Hebrew master till he could pay (Exodus [[22:1-4]]).A night-thief might be smitten till he died (Exodus[[22:2]])."

His method ofproving the existence of the creator of all things wasboth empirical and rational. He invited people toobserve the heavenly bodies and then deduce theexistence of an absolute creator from their contingentcharacteristics. God supports this empirical andrational methodology.Abraham, not only supported his monotheistic faiththrough rational arguments, but also falsified theclaims of his opponents via rational arguments bybreaking the little statutes of his pagan people andsparing the biggest one. When the polytheistsinquired about the \"disbeliever\" who committed sucha blasphemous act to their idols, Abraham stood upand pointed at the biggest statute, thereby forcing hispeople to reflect and examine their religious dogmas ([[21:51-67]]).The Quran provides a rational argument for why Godcannot have partners or equals. The argument inverse [[21:21-22]] is a logical argument called DenyingAntecedent. Thus, it is no wonder that the Quraninvites us not to be gullible. We should not followanything without sufficient knowledge, includingbelief in God ([[17:36]]).Abraham's methodology of emphasizing reason,valiantly examining the religious dogmas of hispeople, engaging his opponents with intellectualdialogues, and occasionally modeling the thinkingprocess for his audience, later was made famous bySocrates, a messenger of God to Greece. Socrates,like Abraham criticized the superstitions andpolytheistic religious dogmas of his people throughdialogues where he subjected them to a series ofquestions and inferences.

Knowing thatnumerous disgraceful and wicked stories were falselyattributed to Muhammad to justify the actions ofcorrupt and oppressive rulers who came after him, weare justified in speculating that the real motive behindthe x-rated and v-rated Biblical stories was mostlikely to reduce the guilt from the fabricators of thestories who themselves either committed orcontemplated similar acts of sexual abuse andviolence, or to reduce the guilt of their criminalfriends and rulers.

Also, see [[12:109]];[[33:4]]; [[39:29]]; [[72:5]].The idea of limbo has been much more importantamong Catholics. However, in 2006, after a week-long deliberation, the Theological Commissionrecommended to Pope Benedict XVI that he abolishlimbus infantium which has been in existence for thelast 700 years. Below is an excerpt from theInternationalist Humanist News authored by BabuGogineni about this \"radical restructuring of theheavens\":\"Since early days, Christians have wrestled with thethorny question of the fate of unbaptised prophets, aswell as the fate of children who die before they arebaptized. Catholics believe that all human beings,with the exception of Mary and Jesus, are born inoriginal sin and that only the ritual of baptism willcleanse their sins and will redeem them. Withoutbaptism, there can be no union of the believer withChrist in His death, burial and resurrection, and therecan be no holy communion with God, either in thislife or in the next. Such a person cannot go to heaveneven if he or she has never committed sin.\"To help solve the problem, St. Gregory of Nazianzus(329-390 AD) proposed that the unbaptised shouldneither be punished nor could they access the fullglory of God. However, the hardliner St Augustine ofHippo (354-430 AD) rejected this idea, insisting thatbaptism was necessary for salvation, and that evenbabies would be consigned to hell if they were notbaptized. Though St. Augustine made the generousconcession that their torment would be the mildest ofall of hell's residents, this torture of the innocent wasunacceptable to St Thomas Aquinas (1226-1274 AD),the first major theologian to speculate about theexistence of a place called limbo where these soulswould be lodged for ever. Limbo is now a part ofCanon Law. \"This safe passage to heaven that the Catholic Churchnow assures children who are dying young is asignificant step in the right direction. One should nowhope and pray that in the Catholic heaven thechildren will also receive adequate protection fromsexual abuse by Catholic priests. Since the Churchdid not deem sexual abuse by its clergy a matterworthy of punishment in this world, they will all nodoubt now be going to heaven too. The Church needsto take immediate steps to ensure that the millions oflittle children who are now being admitted to heavenare adequately protected in line with the Holy See'sinternational obligations as an early ratifier of the1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child.\"On the other hand, a Lutheran theologian Martin EMarty, in an article published at Christian Post,criticized the timing of this papal amendment and itsramification:\"The post-limbo announcement awakens all kinds ofresponses, many of them easily accessible on theinternet or in the press. Taunters who have heard thatCatholicism does not change now taunt, \"Here's achange.\" Catholic pastors who have always found thereference to limbo, a place of non-descriptness andnon-happening, to be more chilling than comfortingto parents of unbaptized children can be relieved ofthe charge to pass on word about it. Catholics wholean toward a most expansive Catholic view ofsalvation and tend toward universalism cheer, for thisproclamation that unbaptized infants can go straightto heaven might open the door for Catholic witnessthat some non-infants could have the sameexperience. \"Pro-choice\" Catholics are coming onrecord as seeing that this can fortify their cause: Iffetuses are babies, and they no longer go to limbo butcan go to heaven, then abortion may not be as dire afate as it is often pictured to be. Abort and send themprematurely to heaven. Catholic traditionalists you'll find plenty of them  rage at Pope Benedictand others involved in this announcement, seeingthem as traitors to the Catholic cause: If this canchange, can't other things? Relativism, which thepope abhors, will take over.\"Pope Benedict made clear in his announcement thatlimbo was never an infallible teaching and was noteven a formal doctrine of the church. We wonderwhether generations of parents who sufferedendlessly as they imagined their infants endlesslydenied the vision of God or much of any other kindof vision knew of that nuance. Those of us who arenot Catholic, and who care about Catholic teachingand Catholic parents, but cannot appreciate all theniceties of gradation of authority among \"infallible\"and \"not quite infallible\" and \"traditional\" and \"easyto change\" teachings, will look for clarification.\"So will Catholics of many stripes, including somewho had not thought about limbo for a long time, butin response to press coverage now find themselves inan intellectual limbo.\""

If universe started 13.7 billion years ago,ignoring the possibility of early inflation, then 4/6thof this, would be approximately 9 billion years,which is about 4 billion years more than currentlyestimated age.According to the Bible, God created the universe fora special purpose (Psalms [[135:6]]), and creation showsthe power of God (Isaiah [[40:26,28]]), His glory andhandiwork (Psalms [[19:1]]), and the wisdom of God(Psalms [[104:24]]; [[136:5]]). In six days. Exodus [[20:11]];[[31:17]]). First day, making light and dividing it fromdarkness (Genesis [[1:3-5]]; 2Co [[4:6]]). Second day,making the firmament or atmosphere, and separatingthe waters (Genesis [[1:6-8]]). Third day, separating theland from the water, and making it fruitful (Genesis[[1:9-13]]). Fourth day, placing the sun, moon, and starsto give light (Genesis [[1:14-19]]). Fifth day, makingbirds, insects, and fish (Genesis [[1:20-23]]). Sixth day,making beasts of the earth, and man (Genesis[[1:24,28]]). God rested on the seventh day (Genesis [[2:2]]-3). Those who distorted the revelation in the Biblemisunderstood the meaning of the phrase \"six days\"as \"six 24-hour days.\" According to the Bible, theearth is only 5700-plus years old.The Quran rejects the assertion of God \"resting\" onthe seventh day ([[50:38]])."

      "35": "The Quran uses more than a hundredattributes for God, and attributes indicate continuity.Not every verb used for God can be considered anattribute. For instance, not every person who writescan be called a \"writer.\" Furthermore, God'sattributes are not necessarily Arabic. God sentmessengers in many different languages to eachnation, and informed them about His attributes intheir languages. Thus, the Quran teaches us that toGod belong all beautiful attributes. However, hadithbooks lists 99 attributes of which some cannot beconsidered \"beautiful.\" The list, which is verypopular among Sunni and Shiite mushriks and manypeople memorize, include \"bad\" names such as al-Dar (the one who harms). Quran tells us otherwise([[42:30]]).Those who have confused Arab nationalism withislam might criticize our use of the English word Godin the English text, rather than the word Allah. Wewould like to pull the attention of those who are notintoxicated with hadith and sunna that promotes Arabculture to the following points: the word Allah is nota proper name; it is an Arabic word contraction of thearticle Al (the) and Elah (god). Also, see [[2:165]]; [[3:26]];[[6:12]]; [[17:110]]; [[20:52]]; [[42:11]]; [[58:7]].The Quran informs us that God has been sendingmessengers to every nation in their own language([[14:4]]). In each language, names or attributesrepresented by different sounds and symbols are usedfor the creator. For instance, the Old Testament usesYehovah or Elohim. The New Testament quotes fromJesus addressing to God as Eloi (my lord), which isvery close to the Arabic word Elahi (my lord) (Mark[[15:34]]).Through distortion and mistranslations, some Biblicalverses depict God as less than a perfect being. Forinstance, Judges [[1:19]] (powerless); Genesis [[6:6-7]](fallible); Psalms [[13:1]]; Lamentations [[5:20]] (forgetful);Genesis [[3:8-10]] (can't see); 1 Samuel [[15:2-3]] (cruel).For more on divine attributes in the Quran and theBible, see [[59:22-24]].The Quran contains more than a hundred attributesfor God and they are designed letter by letter inaccordance with the mathematical structure based oncode 19. The studies of Prof. Adib Majul, which wascontinued by Edip Yuksel on the attributes of God,demonstrate an interlocking system. For instance,among the attributes of God, the frequency of onlyfour of them are multiples of 19. They are Shahyd(Witness) 19, Allah (God) 2698, Rahman (Gracious)57, Rahym (Compassionate) 114 times. When weanalyze the attributes of God in according to theirnumerical values, we learn that only four of them aremultiples of 19 and each correspond to the frequencyof the other four: Wahid (One) 19, Zulfadl-il Azym(The Possessor of Great Bounty) 2698, Majyd(Glorious) 57, and Jami (Editor) 114.

They distorted the meaning of the verseinto \"their prayer is only clapping hands andwhistles\" so that Meccan polytheists will be seen tobe bizarre and different. The word muka meanswhistle, noise, or hypocrisy. The celebrated Arabicdictionary Lisan al-Arab, under the definition of thisword, lists underground escape holes dug by moles.This resembles the word nafaqa (hypocrisy), whichrelates a semantic relation between physical holesand abstract hypocrisy.

Verse [[9:1]] attributes the ultimatumissued in this chapter to \"God and His messenger.\"Since, God did not author the Quran in consultationwith Muhammad, the only reason why the messengerwas mentioned after God, is that the messenger willdeliver the ultimatum as it is, like a trustworthymailman. Thus, we should use similar inferenceswhen we see verses telling us to \"obey God and Hismessenger.\" Those verses do not mean God and Hismessenger represent different authorities or sources,but simply mean, \"Obey God by obeying the messagebrought to you through His messenger.\" In the Quranwe do not see a single verse instructing us to \"obeyMuhammad\" or \"obey Moses;\" the verses alwaysrefer to obeying the messenger, since messengers'sole mission is to deliver God's message withoutdistorting, adding, or subtracting from it.

      "2": "The verse [[9:5]] does not encouragemuslims to attack those who associate partners toGod, but to attack those who have violated the peacetreaty and killed and terrorized people because oftheir belief and way of life.According to verses [[9:5]] and [[9:11]], the aggressiveparty has two ways to stop the war: reinstate thetreaty for peace (silm), which is limited in scope; oraccept the system of peace and submission to God(islam), which is comprehensive in scope; it includesobservation of sala and purification through sharingone's blessings. These two verses refer to the secondalternative. When, accepting islam (system of peaceand submission) as the second equally acceptablealternative and when the first alternative involvesonly making a temporary peace, then none can arguefor coercion in promoting the Din.The Quran does not promote war, but encourages usto stand against aggressors on the side of peace andjustice. War is permitted only in self-defense (See[[2:190,192,193,256]]; [[4:91]]; [[5:32]]; [[8:19]]; [[60:7-9]]). We areencouraged to work hard to establish peace ([[47:35]];[[8:56-61]]; [[2:208]]). The Quranic precept promotingpeace and justice is so fundamental that a peacetreaty with the enemy is preferred to religious ties([[8:72]]).Please note that the context of the verse is about theWar of Hunain, which was provoked by the enemy.The verse [[9:29]] is mistranslated by almost everytranslator.Furthermore, note that we suggest \"reparation,\"which is the legal word for compensation fordamages done by the aggressing party during the war,instead of the Arabic word jizya. The meaning ofjizya has been distorted as a perpetual tax on non-Muslims, which was invented long after Muhammadto further the imperialistic agenda of Sultans orKings. The origin of the word that we translated asCompensation is JaZaYa, which simply meanscompensation, not tax. Because of their aggressionand initiation of a war against muslims and theirallies, after the war, the allied community shouldrequire their enemies to compensate for the damagethey inflicted on the peaceful community. Variousderivatives of this word are used in the Quranfrequently, and they are translated as \"compensation\"for a particular deed.Unfortunately, the distortion in the meaning of theverse above and the practice of collecting a specialtax from Christians and Jews, contradicts the basicprinciple of the Quran that there should not becompulsion in religion and that there should befreedom of belief and expression ([[2:256]]; [[4:90]]; [[4:140]];[[10:99]]; [[18:29]]; [[88:21,22]]). Since taxation based onreligion creates financial duress on people to convertto the privileged religion, it violates this importantQuranic principle. Dividing a population that isunited under a social contract (constitution) intoprivileged groups based on their religion contradictsmany principles of the Quran, including justice,peace, and brotherhood/sisterhood of all humanity.See [[2:256]]. For a comparative discussion of this verse,see the Sample Comparisons section in theIntroduction.Moral rules involving retaliation can be classifiedunder several titles:<ul> <li> The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</li><li> The Silver Rule: Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you.</li><li> The Golden-plated Brazen Rule: Do unto others as they do unto you; and occasionally forgive them.</li><li> The Brazen Rule: Do unto others as they do unto you.</li><li> The Iron Rule: Do unto others as you like, before they do it unto you.</li></ul>Empirical studies on groups have shown that thegolden-plated brazen rule is the most efficient inreducing negative behaviors in a community abidingby the rule, since the rule has both deterrence andguiding components. Game theorists call this rule\"Generous Tit-For-Tat\" (GTFT), a rule that leads oneparty to cooperate as long as the other party does too.If the other party cheats or hurts the party adoptingGTFT, then the GTFT-adopting party stopscooperation and retaliates, while demonstratingwillingness to forgive the wrongdoing and start a newstage of cooperation. This positive tilt successfullyleads the other party to seek cooperation of the GTFparty and ultimately adopt the same rule ofengagement. The Golden rule, on the other hand,does not correspond to the reality of human nature; itrewards those who wish to take advantage of theother party's niceness. Therefore, though the goldenrule is the most popular rule on the lips of people, itis the least used rule in world affairs. It might havesome merits in small groups with intimate relations,but we do not have evidence for that.The Quran is a book of reality, and its instructionsinvolving social issues consider the side effects offreedom. Thus, the Quran recommends us to employthe golden-plated brazen rule. \"If the enemy inclinestoward peace, do you also incline toward peace\"([[8:61]]; [[4:90]]; [[41:34]]). Other verses encouragingforgiveness and patience in the practice of retaliation([[2:178]]; [[16:126]], etc.), make the Quranic rule a\"Golden-plated Brazen Rule,\" the most efficient rulein promoting goodness and discouraging crimes.Sunni and Shiite mushriks inherited many viciouslaws and instructions of violence through hadithbooks, most of which scholars trace their roots to theinfluence of Jewish Rabbis and Christian priests whosupposedly converted to Islam. Here are somesamples of terrifying and bloody instructions found inThe Old Testament. We recommend the reader tostudy them in their context:\"The Lord said to Moses: 'Take the blasphemeroutside the camp. All those who heard him are to laytheir hands on his head, and the entire assembly is tostone him. Say to the Israelites: If anyone curses hisGod, he will be held responsible; anyone whoblasphemes the name of the Lord must be put todeath. The entire assembly must stone him. Whetheran alien or native-born, when he blasphemes theName, he must be put to death.... Then Moses spoketo the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outsidethe camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as theLord commanded Moses\" (Leviticus [[24:13-16]]).\"Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman whohas slept with a man. But save for yourselves everygirl who has never slept with a man\" (Numbers[[31:18]]).\"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city,both man and woman, young and old, and ox, andsheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword\"(Joshua [[6:21]]).\"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy allthat they have, and spare them not; but slay both manand woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, cameland ass\" (1 Samuel [[15:3]]).\"And as David returned from the slaughter of thePhilistine, Abner took him, and brought him beforeSaul with the head of the Philistine in his hand\" (1Samuel [[17:57]]).\"Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with thestroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction,and did what they would unto those that hated them\"(Esther [[9:5]]).\"Why do the wicked prosper and the treacherous alllive at ease?... But you know me, Lord, you see me;you test my devotion to you. Drag them away likesheep to the shambles; set them apart for the day ofslaughter\" (Jeremiah [[12:1-3]]).\"A curse on all who are slack in doing the Lord'swork! A curse on all who withhold their swords frombloodshed!\" (Jeremiah [[48:10]]).Chapter 20 of Leviticus contains a list of very severepunishments for various sins. For instance, cursingone's own father or mother would prompt the deathpenalty. A man marrying a woman together with herdaughter must be burned in the fire. Homosexual menmust be put to death. Those who commit bestialitymust be put to death together with the animals. Andmany more deaths, and burning penalties."

In mid 20th century, scientists learnedthat the rotation of Earth was not sufficiently uniformas a standard of time. Besides solar gravity, there aremany factors influencing the rotation of the earth. Forinstance, though in minor way, the Moon's gravitythrough tides causes deceleration, and melting of icein the North Pole causes little acceleration. Tocompensate this net deceleration, almost every yearwe are adding one second to our atomic clocks,which defines and measures a second as9,192,631,770 electromagnetic radiation oroscillation of Cesium 133. Since 1972 we added 23leap seconds until 2006. However, the rate of thedeceleration does not show a pattern. In recent years,the earth's rotation has been on schedule. See. [[9:122]]"

Then, why the qualification \"First\"? Well,the name of the following month provides anexplanation: Rabi ul-Akhir (Second Fourth), which isthe fourth month from the beginning of the year. Inother words we have two months called \"Fourth,\" thefirst one referring to the fourth restricted moth, withthe second fourth referring to the fourth month of thelunar year.

Below is a list ofmiracles/signs mentioned in the Quran:<ul> <li> Some of the Children of Israel are resurrected on Earth after being killed ([[2:56]]).</li><li> Moses causes 12 springs to gush forth ([[2:60]]).</li><li> A man dies and is resurrected after 100 years ([[2:259]]).</li><li> Abraham kills four birds and brings them back to life ([[2:260]]).</li><li> Zechariah’s wife gives birth while infertile ([[3:40]]).</li><li> Mary gives birth while being a virgin ([[3:47]]).</li><li> Jesus heals the blind, lepers ([[3:49]]).</li><li> Jesus raises the dead ([[3:49]]).</li><li> Angels descend to fight alongside the prophet ([[3:125]]).</li><li> God speaks to Moses ([[4:164]]).</li><li> Jesus brings down a feast from heaven ([[5:112]]).</li><li> Moses turns his staff into a serpent ([[7:107]]).</li><li> Moses’ hand becomes pure white ([[7:108]]).</li><li> God reveals Himself physically to a mountain ([[7:143]]).</li><li> Abraham’s wife gives birth while beyond menstruation ([[11:72]]).</li><li> The sleepers of the cave survive 309 years in sleep ([[18:25]]).</li><li> Jesus speaks from birth ([[19:29]]).</li><li> Abraham survives being burned alive by the fire turning cold ([[21:69]]).</li><li> Solomon commands the winds ([[21:81]]).</li><li> Moses parts the sea and saves the Children of Israel ([[26:63]]).</li><li> Solomon speaks to the birds ([[27:16]]).</li><li> Solomon moves a palace across time and space ([[27:40]]).</li></ul>"

      "7": "The Arabic word BaYaNa means (1)explain an ambiguous message; or (2) declare ahidden message. This multiple-meaning verse is oneof the most abused verses by the followers of hadithhearsay. They choose the first meaning. Theirrendering, however, contradicts many verses of theQuran: the Quran is explained not by Muhammad,but by its author, God Himself ([[75:19]]). Thus it isdescribed as a \"clarified/explained book\" ([[5:15]]; [[12:1]];[[26:195]]; [[44:6]]), and we are reminded over and overthat it is \"easy to understand\" ([[54:17,22,32,40]]). Thus,the second alternative is the intended meaning, sincethe Quran was received by Muhammad in a privatesession called revelation, and his job was to deliverand declare the message he received. God ordersMuhammad to proclaim the revelation which isrevealed to him personally. Indeed, this is the wholemission of the messengers ([[16:35]]). Thus, the word\"litubayyena\" of [[16:44]] is similar to the one in [[3:187]].Verse [[3:187]] tells us that the people who received therevelation should \"proclaim the scripture to thepeople, and never conceal it.\" See [[2:159,160]]; [[3:187]]and [[16:64]]. For a comparative discussion on verse[[16:44]], see the Sample Comparisons section in theIntroduction.The Quran is simple to understand ([[54:11]]). Whoeveropens his/her mind and heart as a monotheist andtakes the time to study it, will understand it. Thisunderstanding will be enough for salvation. Beyondthis, to understand the multiple-meaning verses youdo not need to be a messenger of God. If you have agood mind and have studied the Quran as a believer,that is, if you have a deep knowledge, then you willbe able to understand the true meanings of multiple-meaning verses. The verse [[3:7]], which is about themultiple-meaning verses, points this fact in amultiple-meaning way (this is an interesting subjectwarranting another article): \". . .

      "8": "The human body, whether belonging to anappreciative or unappreciative person, as a whole haspeacefully surrendered to its Creator, and thus is amuslim (submitter/peaceful surrenderer to God).It is true that SaJDa means obedience, submission toGod's law ([[16:49]]). From this verse we should notnecessarily infer that everything has a mind likehumans. Even if we subscribe to such a fancyassumption, mental events too are physical events;they are the consequence of interactions of electrons.In fact, the prostration of all the creatures weperceive is physical. Any event that can be sensed byour five senses is a physical event. Atoms peacefullysurrender to God's laws when they interact with eachother. When water freezes it peacefully surrenders toGod's law and expands; when it is heated to a certaindegree it evaporates. When Hydrogen, Carbon,Nitrogen, and Oxygen atoms come together in aparticular order and create bases called Adenine,Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine, and when thesebases join each other in a particular order, pre-ordained by God, they create DNAs that produce newqualities and events, including life. Every cell andorgan in our bodies submits to God's law. These areall physical demonstration of SaJDa to God. Nowonder, the entire universe is stated to havesubmitted to God ([[3:83]]; [[13:15]]). Interestingly, in thesetwo verses the same idea is depicted yet in [[3:83]] theverb aSLaMa (submitted) is used while in [[13:15]] theverb yaSJuDu (prostrating) is used. This is strongevidence that both verbs belong to the same semanticfield. As we know, submission to God is not just amental activity but also a physical action, such asworking hard, delivering God's message, feeding thepoor, etc.The word SaJDa in some verses means ONLYmental (in quantum, electronic or neural level)prostration while in other verses it means ONLYbodily (atomic and molecular level) prostration. Theprostration mentioned in [[27:20-24]] must be bodily,and the one in verse [[77:48]] most likely refers tomental prostration.As for verse [[22:18]], it describes both mental andbodily submission to God. One might argue, \"Hasanyone ever seen any of these creations bow andprostrate on the ground (animals excluded)? Since allthings in heavens and earth do not prostrate to Godby casting themselves face down on the ground inhumility, then we should not prostrate that wayeither.\" This conclusion is based on a falseassumption that ALL creatures prostrate the sameway. Every creature in the heavens and the earthglorifies God ([[24:41]]; [[57:1]]; [[59:1,24]]; [[61:1]]; [[62:1]]; [[64:1]]).But we do not understand their glorification ([[17:44]]).We are also instructed to glorify our Lord day andnight, not like birds or planets, but like humans, inour language and according to our natural design([[3:41]]; [[5:98]]; [[7:206]]; [[19:11]]; [[20:130]]; [[32:15]]; [[40:55]];[[50:39-40]]; [[52:48-49]]; [[56:74,96]]; [[69:52]]; [[76:26]]; [[87:1]];[[110:3]]).Hence: \"Do you not see that everything in theheavens and the earth glorify God, including the birdsin columns. Each knows his/her/its prayer (sala) andglorification. God is fully aware of everything youdo.\" ([[24:41]]).The following verse is also important: \"Are theyseeking other than God's religion, when everythinghas submitted (aSLaMa) to Him in the heavens andthe earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him theywill be returned?\" ([[3:83]]). Now those who reject thatsala prayer includes bodily bowing and prostrationshould ask a similar question about how to be amuslim just as they ask about how to performprostration: \"Has anyone ever seen any of thesecreations give charity or deliver God's message orstudy the Quran?\" So, according to those who denythat we must both mentally and bodily prostrate forGod, we should not give charity, should not deliverthe message, should not study the Quran, and shouldnot use computers?!!One might refer to [[2:62]] and ask: \"No, not all of thementioned people bow and prostrate on the ground.Will they be punished? No, it is the people who donot submit to the God and follow His commands thatwill deserve His punishment.\" This is a hastyconclusion. The groups mentioned in the verse(believers, Jews, Nazarenes, and those from otherreligions) attain salvation as long as they believe inGod, do righteous work and believe in the hereafter.Perhaps not all these groups bow and prostrate, andperhaps not all these groups believe and follow theQuran, either. First, we should remember that Godholds each responsible depending on theircircumstances. As those who witnessed Moses'miracles will be hold responsible for their reaction tothem, similarly those who are instructed to bow andprostrate will be held responsible for their reaction.Each nation received a messenger and each receivedtheir instruction ([[10:47]]; [[22:34]]; [[40:28]]).Referring to verse [[18:50]], one might conclude: \"Thereis no need to get on the ground to worship your Lordbecause He has not commanded us to do this. Hewants us to bow and prostrate our wills to that of Hiswill.\" This is a reasonable conclusion. However,knowing that the word prostration was also used tomean humbly getting on the ground, we cannotequate the prostration in this verse to all others. Theverse refers to an event which took place before thecreation of life on earth. Besides, the instruction is toSatan, a creature made of energy, not matter like us.The nature of the prostration asked of Satan or theangels might be a little different than the one asked ofus; or, more accurately, the form, way or style of ourprostration might not necessarily be expected to bethe same as that of the angels.David, who was observing sala prayer, is describedby the Quran as: \" He then implored his Lord forforgiveness, bowed down (KhaRra RuKka'An), andrepented.\" ([[38:24]]). David's repentance is clearlydescribed as bowing down, both mentally and bodily.We should remind those who are trying hard toeliminate the formal component of sala prayer of thefollowing verse: \" When the revelations of theGracious are recited to them, they fall prostrate(KhaRRu SuJjaDan), weeping\" ([[19:58]]). See [[41:37]];[[13:15]]; [[3:83]]."

It warns us against blindly following areligious teaching or political ideology and asks as tobe iconoclasts. It warns us not to be hypnotized bythe charisma of leaders nor by the social conventions.A society comprised of individuals that value rationaland empirical inquiry will never become the victimof religious fanaticism, tragedies brought bycharismatic politicians. A religion or sect thatglorifies ignorance and gullibility can be verydangerous for its followers and others. As thePhysicist Steven Weinberg once put profoundly,\"With or without religion, you would have goodpeople doing good things, and evil people doing evilthings. But for good people to do evil things, thattakes religion.\" See [[6:74-83]].The following advice is attributed to Buddha. We arenot quoting this because we consider his name to bean authority, nor because we are sure that it is utteredor written by a man called Buddha; but because itarticulates a profound fact: \"Do not put faith intraditions, even though they have been accepted forlong generations and in many countries. Do notbelieve a thing because many repeat it. Do not accepta thing on the authority of one or another of the sagesof old, nor on the ground of statements as found inthe books. Never believe anything becauseprobability is in its favor. Do not believe in thatwhich you yourselves have imagined, thinking that agod has inspired it. Believe nothing merely on theauthority of the teachers or the priests. Afterexamination, believe that which you have tested foryourself and found reasonable, which is inconformity with your well being and that of others'.\"Interestingly, this is the summary of many verses inthe Quran! If the above wise statements were indeedmade by Buddha, then he would be the first one whowould reject the allegiance of the so-calledBuddhists.The Biblical, \"Know the truth, and the truth will setyou free!\" (John [[3:24]]), is a powerful statementagainst idolatry and ignorance. St. Paul and hisfollowers, such as Tertullian and many other churchleaders turned the wisdom preached by Jesus intobigotry and dogmatism that considered philosophyand philosophers the enemy. Most faithful ofreligions nod positively at Voltaire's depiction oftheir understanding: \"The truths of religion are neverso well understood as by those who have lost thepower of reasoning.\"If I really want to name myself with suffixes such asan ist, ite, or an, then I should call myselfTruthist, Truthite, or Truthian! Or, maybe just,Godist, Godite, Godian!The Quran repeatedly advises us to use our intellect,to reason, to be open-minded, to be the seekers oftruth, to be philosophers, to be critical thinkers, andnot to be the followers of our wishful thinking or aparticular crowd. For instance, see [[2:170]], 171, 242,269; [[3:118]], 190; [[6:74-83]]; [[7:169]]; [[8:22]]; [[10:42]], 100;[[11:51]]; [[12:2]], 111; [[13:4]], 19; [[16:67]]; [[21:10]], 67; [[23:80]];[[24:61]]; [[29:63]]; [[30:28]]; [[38:29]]; [[39:9]], 18, 21; [[40:54]];[[59:14]].

However, this couldbe only a secondary meaning of this particular verse,since the adjective wahdehu is used not after theword Rab (Lord) but after the word Quran. In Arabicif one wants to say ‘Quran alone,’ the only way ofsaying it is \"Quranun wahdahu.\" The mathematicalstructure of the Quran too confirms our translation.For instance, the word wahdahu is used for God in[[7:70]]; [[39:45]]; [[40:12,84]] and [[60:4]].

Disproportionalto their population, Jews have exhibited astonishingexamples in both good and bad, in both success andblunder, and they have enjoyed a vivid presence inworld politics for millennia. This explains why theQuran mentions them so frequently both in negative([[3:71]]; [[4:46]]; [[5:78-82]]; [[5:60-65]]; [[7:166]]) and positiveterms ([[2:47,62]]; [[3:33]]; [[5:20]]).After being subjected to genocide and atrocioustortures by European fascist forces, Jews werescattered around the world as immigrants. Yet, theydid not disappear from the global scene or takecenturies to recover, as many other nations would do.A prophecy of the Old Testament, Deuteronomy[[30:4-20]] was fulfilled. Not surprisingly, with the helpof the major powers of the time, they were able toestablish their own independent state in 1948, soonafter their almost utter annihilation; a state not inGermany, but in their historical land, which has onceagain become the focal point of a global conflict,stirring the world by showcasing human aggression,greed, hatred, cruelty, racism, and terror.

Indeed, some modern birthclinics provide birth-in-water services. The oxytocinfound in dates regulates contraction and stimulateslactation, and thus is given to pregnant women as adrug to ease their labor. See [[4:82]].This verse gives a clue regarding the season in whichJesus was born. In the Middle East, dates get ripe inthe end of September, and in the beginning ofOctober.Jesus was born in Nazareth, not Bethlehem(beit/house+lahm/meat) as a majority of Christiansbelieve today. The information in the Gospelsregarding the origin of his parents is contradictory;Luke points to Nazareth, while Matthew points toBethlehem (Matthew [[1:18-25]]; [[2:1-12]]; Luke [[2:4-7]]).Jesus was called the Nazarene in the New Testament(Mark [[1:24,10]]:47,[[14:67,16]]:6), yet Christian scholarsare not sure why he was called Nazarene. Perhaps,this is because the Old Testament does not mentionNazareth, but mentions Bethlehem (Genesis[[35:16,19]]; [[48:7]]; Ruth [[4:11]]; 1 Samuel [[17:12]]; 2 Samuel[[23:13-17]]).

According to a very popularhadith, God supposedly had said to Muhammad,Lawlaka lawlaka lama khalaqtul aflaka (if it werenot you, if it were not you, I would not have createdthe universes). Under the name Qudsi Hadith (HolyHadith), clerics and their blind followers attributemany false statements directly to God. If you studythe longest story told in Bukhari, there you will findMuhammad ascending and descending numeroustimes between the sixth and seventh heavens,between Moses and God, trying to get as much of adiscount possible, in the number of prayers. Thisbargain between God and Muhammad, which wassupervised by Moses, is reminded to the public atleast once a year during the celebration of the \"Nightof Miraj.\" The message given to the audience issimple and polytheistic: \"If it were not forMuhammad's bargain on your behalf, you would endup praying 50 times a day (one session every 28minutes, day and night); and you would suffergreatly.\" Whether this story was originally made upby a Jew to insult the intelligence of Muhammad andexalt Moses, it is adopted by gullible Muhammedansto praise the mercy of their prophet (more mercifulthan God!), and to justify their belief in his power ofintercession and negotiation with God on their behalf.The reporters and collectors of this story, includingBukhari, were the archenemies of prophetMuhammad and his monotheistic message. See [[2:285]]; [[3:159]]; [[6:112]]; [[68:42]].For the struggle, leadership and message of this braveservant of God, see the books of Exodus andDeuteronomy in Old Testament. Psalms and Prophetstoo contain numerous references to Moses. Forinstance, see Jeremiah [[1:5]]. The New Testamentquotes Jesus comparing people's reaction to hismessage to their reaction to the message delivered byMoses (John [[5:46]]). However, Luke, in Acts [[7:37]],tries to make a connection between Jesus and \"theprophet like Moses\" prophesied in Deuteronomy[[18:15,18-19]]. A comparative study on the history ofMoses, Jesus, and Muhammad will show thatMuhammad was much more like Moses than Jesuswas.

      "5": "It is interesting that the Quran usuallymentions hell and paradise after each other. While theappreciative see and enjoy the promise of heaven, theunappreciative people complain about how bad hellis. Ironically, they try very hard to enter the placethey are so critical of. Though many people will endup in hell forever, it does not mean that hell iseternal. Similarly, verses informing us aboutdisbelievers or idol worshipers staying in Helleternally, does not necessarily mean that Hell iseternal, unless we are informed that Hell itself iseternal. It simply means that disbelievers and idolworshipers would end up in Hell and nothing else. IfHell together with its inhabitants one day ceased toexist, then the disbelievers or idol worshipers wouldhave stayed in Hell eternally. Their punishmentwould be the entire life of Hell.In fact, the Quran informs us that both the eternalpunishment in Hell and reward in Paradise isconditioned on their life span ([[11:107]]). Let's reflecton verse [[40:11]] and [[67:2]]. The first verse refers to twocreations and two deaths and the second refers tocreation of death and life. These two verses can beunderstood better if we know that in the Quraniclanguage, death cannot exist without life and viceversa. They exist together, since Death is thepermanent halt of the brain's conscious activity([[39:42]]; [[16:21]]) and a temporal stage to be followed byresurrection ([[29:57]]; [[10:56]]; [[22:6]]). Death is a processwhich leads to life. A living creature will die and adead creature will get a new life ([[22:66]]). Vegetationexperiences successive lives and deaths throughseasons ([[2:64]]; [[3:27]]; [[6:95]]; [[16:65]]; [[22:5-6]]; [[30:19-50]];[[35:9]]). After the first creation there was no death norlife; we just existed. But, God decided to create deathand life ([[67:2]]). Creation, death, life (current), death,life (resurrection). In other words, two deaths andtwo lives ([[40:11]]). The word HaLaKa, on the otherhand, is occasionally used to describe the death of anindividual ([[40:34]]), but usually irreversibledestruction and annihilation, or total existentialextinction of an entity ([[5:17]]; [[6:6]]; [[6:47]]; [[8:42]]; [[20:128]];[[21:95]]; [[22:45]]; [[28:59]]; [[36:31]]; [[69:5]]; [[77:16]]).The Quran informs us that the Earth and the Heavenswill be changed with a different Earth and Heavens([[14:48]]). If the re-creation referred to in this verse isthe one before the Day of Judgment, then there is thepossibility of another re-creation. There areindications that Paradise will be preserved or createdagain. For instance, the word KHuLD (eternal,everlasting) is not used for Hell, but it is used as anadjective to describe Paradise ([[25:15]]). On the otherhand the same adjective is not used to describe Hell,but to describe the punishment in Hell ([[10:52]]; [[41:28]]).Verse [[8:42]] does not only refer to the loss of lives andsurviving a particular battle, but also to a highercosmic event: disbelievers will perish forever sincethey relied on falsehood, while believers will lastforever since they relied on a clear argument. Nowonder life and death are used as metaphors forattaining truth or falsehood ([[6:122]]). In fact,witnessing and acknowledging the truth leads to life,metaphorically and literally ([[8:24]]). From the aboveverse, it is fair to infer that those who reject thedivine message will lose eternal life. Will they die inHell? The answer is No: \"Anyone who comes to HisLord guilty will deserve Hell, wherein he never dies,nor stays alive.\" ([[20:74]]).Then, the alternative is obvious: total annihilation,ontological extinction together with Hell. Thoseprograms with free choice that chose to corruptthemselves with the worst diabolic viruses (such asassociating partners with God or killing an innocentprogram) will be sentenced to an eternal punishment:after resurrection they will experience a period ofdiagnosis, justice, regret and then with the creation ofa new earth and heaven, they will be hurled to non-existence together with Hell. Perhaps, their memoriestoo will be erased from the minds of their relativeswho chose eternal life by dedicating their religion toGod alone and by leading a righteous life with theday of judgment in mind. It is interesting that theQuran refers to this annihilation through ultimatedeletion from the ultimate record. God's deliberatedeletion of their existence from His mind. ([[34:14]]).The Quran repeatedly comforts us by reminding us ofGod's perfect justice. The following verse provides uswith a precise idea of God's justice and mercy: \"Forthose who did good work there will be the best andmore. . . As for those who earned evil, they willreceive equivalent evil ([[10:27]]).Suffering in an eternal Hell creates a contradictionbetween this divine justice, since eternity can not beequal to an evil committed during a limited humanlife-span. However, eternal punishment for thelifetime of a non-eternal Hell avoids such acontradiction. After receiving an equivalentpunishment, the chief evil-doers like those referred toin verse [[4:48]], will be eliminated from existence.They will end up in Hell and Hell will end up innothingness. No wonder the first and the mostrepeated verse of the Quran reminds us over and overagain that God is Gracious, Merciful ([[1:1]])."

      "1": "Public shaming, though it has long beenabandoned in Western world, is one of the tools wemay use against crimes. The Quran gives highimportance to the institution of marriage. Social andpsychological problems experienced among millionsof children because of the breakdown of marriageinstitution in otherwise prosperous Western countriesjustify the importance of marriage. Additionally, theharms of the promiscuous lifestyle to the health andwell being of the society is another reason why theQuran takes marriage contract so seriously and issuesa harsh penalty for its violation.The verse emphasizes public shame rather thaninflicting physical pain. The word JaLDa does notmean a stick, but something that will touch the skin,since the word jalda is a derivative of a word that isused for skin (JeLD).Shaming is a social and psychological penalty. Forsuch a penalty to be effective, researchers suggest thefulfillment of the following conditions: (1) Theconvict must be a member of a particular group; (2)The group must approve of the penalty; (3) Theshaming penalty should be delivered to the group andgroup should ignore the convict for a periodphysically, emotionally, and economically; (4) Theconvict who is wished to be shamed must fear thegroup's decision to cut the relation; and (5) Theconvict must have a means to regain the trust of thegroup.First we should be reminded that there is no stoning-to-death punishment for adultery in Islam. Thepunishment of stoning was introduced to the Islamiclaw long after prophet Muhammad through fabricatedhadith. It is the followers of Sunni and Shiite sectsthat adopted the Jewish practice and fabricated themost ridiculous stories, such as the story of a hungryholy goat eating a verse about stoning, etc. Thefollowers of hadith and sunna accept the Jewishpractice and the related silly stories by claiming that\"these verses are not clear about adultery; thus,hadith and sunna explain these verses.\" Knowing theexcuse of those who associate other partners withGod, the first two verses rebut the claim of theunappreciative people by asserting the clarity of itslanguage.The origin of stoning is found in the Old Testament.For instance:\"But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginitybe not found for the damsel: Then they shall bringout the damsel to the door of her father's house, andthe men of her city shall stone her with stones thatshe die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, toplay the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou putevil away from among you.\" (Deuteronomy [[22:20]]-21)According to the Old Testament, a rapist should beforced to marry the girl he violated. This rulepunishes the victim to share the rest of her life withthe violent and shameless man who violated her(Deuteronomy [[22:28-30]]). How can this and manyother unjust laws be imposed by a Just God? (See[[2:59]]; [[2:79]]; [[5:13-15]]; [[5:41-44]]; [[7:162]]; [[9:31]]).See Leviticus [[20:2,27]]; [[24:14-16]]; Numbers [[15:35]];[[35:17]]; Deuteronomy [[13:10]]; [[17:5]]; [[22:21-25]]; Joshua[[7:25]]; 1 Kings [[21:1-29]].

God uses flexiblelanguage, to allow culture, time, climate, age, andsocial dynamics and other variables play a role in thedecision. The underlying reason for thisrecommendation is expressed as protection of womenfrom potential male harassment. There is nothing inthe Quran that instructs the government or the societyto force women, in the name of God, to coverthemselves. A punishment neither in this world nor inhereafter is issued. While the male clerics and thefollowers of their misogynistic teachings are sunk upto their eyebrows in the mud of shirk, the onlyunforgivable sin, somehow they scrupulously splitthe hair of women. Does sanctifying the dress code ofChristian nuns have anything to do with theirpsychological and sexual problems? The versesrecommending women to cover themselves aim toprotect them from the harassment of unrighteousmen. Ironically, women are now harassed more bythe self-righteous men.It is up to women, not men, how long they will lowertheir dress, whether they will cover their breasts ornot. It is a different thing to remind a monotheistwoman nicely to wear modestly for her protectionand perhaps for social order. But, using this issue topatronize and subjugate women is not what the Quranexpects from us. Even worse than this, is to imposethis recommendation onto those women who are notmuslims, since that violates many more Quranicprinciples.The male clerics who covered their intelligence bytheir obsessive interference with women's hair anddress, do not even notice the lesson in verse [[7:26]].Despite the verse informing us that women werewalking in the street with their faces open in front ofMuhammad ([[33:52]]), they still have the audacity topreach to women to cover their faces with veils. See[[33:55]].For the Biblical account of women's dress, which ismostly ignored by Christians, see Genesis [[24:65]];Jeremiah [[4:30]]; Ezekiel [[16:10]]; Zephaniah [[1:8]] ;1Timothy [[2:9]]; 1 Peter [[3:3]]; 1Corintions [[11:15]]."

Its message is universal;not limited to any language, race, or geography(neither of the east nor of the west). Those with openeyes may get its message even without showingmuch effort (gives off light even if not touched byfire). It has meaning inside meaning, message insidemessage (light upon light). Receiving its message is ablessing and its teacher is God Himself (God guideswhomever/whoever wish(es) to His light). The wordnur (light), in the normative case, occurs 33 timesand is never used in plural from in the Quran, whileits antonym is always used in its plural form, zulumat(darknesses), in 23 occurrences, and never in singularform. This implies singularity of the source of truth,which is God, and diversity of the sources offalsehood, which could be Satan, polytheistclergymen, ignorance, peer pressure, wrong choices,acquired weaknesses and addictions, etc.According to the Bible, God created the light first(Genesis [[1:3]]). Light is also used as a metaphor fordivine enlightenment or instruction (Psalms [[119:105]];Isaiah [[8:20]]; Matthew [[4:16]]; Matthew [[5:16]]; John[[5:35]]).

The Queenis depicted by the Quran as someone who is not atyrant, but a reasonable leader who consults others inher affairs, which is one of the main principles in theQuran ([[42:38]]). The Queen of Sheba tested Solomonby sending him some gifts. When she learned that hewas not interested in her wealth or her country'sresources, she became curious about Solomon andaccepted his invitation. The event implies morecommunication between the two leaders and theemergence of a trust between them. Ultimately, sherealizes that Solomon is not one of those corruptkings, but a servant of God with great morals.The Bible mentions this meeting but it contains somedifferences. For instance, in I Kings [[10:1-13]] we learnthat Solomon accepted her valuable gifts, but theQuran tells us that Solomon showed no interest.

After the discovery ofthe code 19, and from the context of this verse, thiscreature (DaBBa) might be understood as a referenceto the computer that uses silicon as its essential part.In traditional books, there are bizarre descriptions ofthis prophesied creature. Contrary to the Quran’spositive depiction of the earth-based creature, hadithbooks contain negative descriptions.Some may object to our interpretation by saying thatthe word DaBBa implies something alive that moves.This objection is reasonable. But, we prefer thecomputer to an animal since we can understand thephrase dabbatan min al-ard not as a creaturegeographically from earth, but rather a creature madeof earth. Thus, we can accept some differences inmobility between the \"dabba from water\" and \"dabbafrom earth.\" Since a computer has many movingparts, from its hard disk to the information carried bytrillions of electrons, it is not a far-fetchedunderstanding of DaBBa.

During the revelationof the Quran, not many people considered the earth amoving object; perhaps none knew about the tectonicmovement of mountains. Early commentators of theQuran also could not comprehend this fact. So, theystruggled to make sense out of this bizarre claim intheir holy book. They claimed that the verse wasreferring to the end of the world. However, theyignored that the verses describing the last Hourdepicted chaos and destruction. The end of the worldis a calamity of cosmic proportions, which creates anutmost shock and panic among those who willexperience it (See chapter 81 and 101 of the Quran).Thus, the unnoticed event described in [[27:88]] cannotbe about the chaos created by the destruction of theuniverse. Indeed, the end of the verse [[27:88]] leaves noroom for such confusion: \"the making of God whoperfected everything.\" The end of the world is neitherthe perfection of art, nor an imperceptible event. Theearly audience of the Quran, unable even to imaginethe motion of the mountains and earth, tried hard toreconcile it with the verses describing the destruction,chaos and panic of the end times. See [[21:33]]; [[36:40]];[[39:5]]; [[68:1]]; [[79:30]].Since the Bible has been tampered by clergymen (SeeQuran [[2:59]]), it contains numerous false informationabout nature and scientific issues.

If the criticuses the same standard, the critic of these verses willfind contradictions in almost every book. If he looksinto biology books, he will similarly get confused. Inone page he will learn that he is made of atoms, inother made of cells, of DNA, sperm, egg, embryo,earthly materials, etc. He would express his disbeliefand confusion with a similar question. A careful andeducated reading of the Quran will reveal thefollowing facts about creation:1. There were times when man did not exist. Billionsof years after the creation of the universe, humanswere created. In other words, we were nothing beforewe were created ([[19:67]]).2. Humans were created according to a divinelyguided evolution ([[29:19-20]]; [[71:14-17]]).3. Creation of man started from clay ([[15:26]]).Our Creator started the biological evolution ofmicroscopic organisms within the layers of clay.Donald E. Ingber, professor at Harvard University, inan article titled \"The Architecture of Life\" publishedas the cover story of Scientific American stated thefollowing:\"Researchers now think biological evolution began inlayers of clay, rather than in the primordial sea.Interestingly, clay is itself a porous network of atomsarranged geodesically within octahedral andtetrahedral forms. But because these octahedra andtetrahedra are not closely packed, they retain theability to move and slide relative to one another. Thisflexibility apparently allows clay to catalyze manychemical reactions, including ones that may haveproduced the first molecular building blocks oforganic life.\"Humans are the most advanced fruits of organic lifestarted millions of years ago from layers of clay.4. Human being is made of water ([[21:30]]).The verse above not only emphasizes the importanceof water as an essential ingredient for organic life,but also clearly refers to the beginning of theuniverse, which we now call the Big Bang. TheQuran's information regarding cosmology is centuriesahead of its time. For instance, verse [[51:47]] informsus that the universe is continuously expanding.Furthermore, the Quran informs us that the universewill collapse back to its origin, confirming the closeduniverse model ([[21:104]]).Verse [[24:45]] repeats the role of water in creation andfollows with a classification of animals according totheir ability to move around and mentions \"two legs.\"Walking on two legs is a crucial point in theevolution of humanoids. Walking on two feet mayinitially appear to be insignificant in the evolutionaryprocess, yet many scientists believe that walking ontwo feet had a significant contribution in humanevolution by enabling Homo Erectus to use tools andgain consciousness, thereby leading to HomoSapiens.5. The human being is made of dust, or earth, whichcontains the essential elements for life ([[3:59]]).6. Human being is the product of long-termevolution, and when human sperm and egg, whichconsist of water and earthly elements, meet eachother in right conditions, they evolve into embryo,fetus, and finally, after 266 days into a human being([[75:37]]; [[16:4]]; [[96:2]]; [[22:5]]).We do not translate the Arabic word alaq as \"clot\";since neither in interspecies evolution norintraspecies evolution, is there a stage where thehuman is a \"clot\". This is a traditional mistranslationof the word, and the error was first noticed by themedical doctor Maurice Bucaille. Any decent Arabicdictionary will give you three definitions for the wordalaq: (1) clot; (2) hanging thing; (3) leech. Earlycommentators of the Quran, lacking the knowledgeof embryology, justifiably picked the \"clot\" as themeaning of the word. However, the author of theQuran, by this multiple-meaning word was referringto embryo, which hangs to the lining of uterus andnourishes itself like a leech. In modern times, we donot have an excuse for picking the wrong meaning.This is one of the many examples of the Quran'slanguage in verses related to science andmathematics: while its words provide a kind ofunderstanding to former generations, its real meaningshines with knowledge of God's creation and naturallaws.

Sunni literature tries to establish ataboo on discussing or criticizing any companion(sahaba, plural ashab) whose names are listed in theso-called authentic books as narrators. In a hadithfalsely attributed to Muhammad, his companions arelikened to stars and following any of them would besufficient for guidance. The Quran, however, gives usa very different picture of Muhammad's companions.The Quran uses the word sahaba and its plural ashabfor all companions of Muhammad, including hisopponents, hypocrites, and muslims ([[34:46]]; [[53:2]];[[81:22]]). The Quran informs us about the existence ofhypocrites among Muhammad's companions;nevertheless, their names are not exposed to thepublic. The reason for not exposing the name of thehypocrites is God's will to implement the test freelyon earth.As it is the case in most religious matters, Sunnisprefer fabricated hadiths to the Quran. In Sunniteaching there is a hierarchy of righteousness, startingfrom the stars of the sky to the next generation andthe next generation. Through this myth, they craftilyestablished ancestor-worship, one of the versions ofpolytheism categorically rejected by the Quran.Shiites, on the other hand, have a stricter rule forcreating idol stars from dead people. They requireMuhammad's or Ali's genes as a pre-requisite forsainthood. Idolizing early generations was a naturalconsequence of their theology: the authority ofhadiths solely relies on the credibility and superiorityof sahaba, and subsequent generations (tabeen, etbatabeen...), whose names have been sanctified in thelists of narrators of hearsay. They found it imperativeto create a blanket protection for all companions,since allowing one to be scrutinized or questionedwould create a slippery slope that would ultimatelyexpose the human nature of the superhuman, ideal,angelic characters. Nevertheless, numerous works bySunni scholars have challenged the mainstreamposition.Even if their history books point at some of those\"holy men\" killing other \"holy men,\" the Sunnisclaim that all will go to heaven; both the murderersand the victims. Sunni sources refuse even tocondemn Muawiya and his governor Marwan whocommitted many atrocities. Though they express theirgrievances for the brutal murdering of Hassan andHussain, prophet Muhammad's grandchildren, Sunnisagain, refuse to criticize, let alone condemn themurderers, who happened to be Muhammad'scompanions when he was alive, or the companions ofhis companions! Sahaba-worship is one of the mainteachings of Sunni sects. Shiites, on the other hand,condemn anyone who somehow participated in theconflict against anyone related to Muhammadthrough Ali and Fatima's lineage. Shiites, rather thanusing the universal criteria of justice and truth, usegenes as their compass to hell or heaven. Theyworship only those ashab (plural of sahaba) whoeither supported Muhammad's son in-law Ali or hischildren. In brief, the historical animosity betweenSunnis and Shiites originates from the differences inthe list of their idols. All other differences aresecondary, and can be found plentiful among theirown subjects."

They regressed tomonkeys like previous generations ([[2:65]]; [[5:60]];[[7:166]]).What is worse, the actions and words ascribed toprophet Muhammad have depicted him with acharacter that is far from exemplary. The Hadithbooks portray the prophet as a phantasmagoriccharacter with multiple personalities. That characteris more fictitious than mythological gods andgoddesses, such as Hermes, Pan, Poseidon andAphrodite. He is a pendulous character, bothbouncing up to deity, and down to the lowest degree.He is both wise and a moron. He is sometimes moremerciful than God and sometimes a cruel torturer. Heis both perfect and criminal, humble and arrogant,chaste and a sex maniac, trustworthy and a cheater,illiterate and an educator, rich and poor, a nepotisticand a democratic leader, caring and a malechauvinist, a believer and a disbeliever, prohibitingHadith and promoting Hadith. You can findnumerous conflicting personalities presented as anexemplary figure. Choose whichever you like. Thispeculiar aspect of Hadith collection is well-describedby the prophetic verses of the Quran ([[68:35-38]]).Furthermore, a similar statement is made aboutAbraham: \"A good example has been set for you byAbraham and those with him\" ([[60:4]], 6). If verse[[33:21]] requires Muhammad's hadith, then why wouldthe verses [[60:4,6]] not also require Abraham's hadith?Which books narrate hadiths from Abraham?Obviously, the only reliable source for both examplesis the Book of God, which narrates the relevantexemplary actions.

      "4": "Killing a human being withoutjustification is a sin for humans, not for God. Godcreates, kills and revives without justification. Angelsof God are not subject to the test like us; and theycarry out God commandments, including taking thelives of children.In verses [[37:101-113]], Abraham told his son that hesaw in his sleep (manam) that he was sacrificing him.The Quran does not state that God ordered him to dothat. He fulfills his dream (not his literalinterpretation of it though) by intending andattempting to sacrifice his son. So, God stops himfrom going further all the way. Though it was notGod who ordered him to sacrifice his son, Abraham'sperfect submission to his literal interpretation of hisvision proved his sincerity. God saved Abraham fromcompleting his misinterpretation of his dream.Abraham was wrong in literally interpreting hisdream since the dream was a metaphor, a dramaticmetaphor reminding him to make God his onlypriority by mentally giving up from beingpreoccupied with his dearest possession. Though hisliteral understanding was wrong, he demonstrated hisperfect submission to God. He fulfilled the realmeaning of the dream. God rewarded his intention,not his knowledge of interpretation. (For sleep anddream, see: See [[25:47]]; [[8:43]]; [[12:6]]; [[30:23]]; [[39:42]];[[78:9]]).The ethical issue involving this dream has beenextensively discussed since Socrates. In Plato'sEuthyphro, Socrates asked a profound question, \"is itright because God says so, or does God say sobecause it is right?\" Because or therefore? Thequestion assumes that God is different from theconcept of goodness, while according to the QuranGod is the Truth, the Wise, the Noble, and theJustice. The correct answer might be affirmative forboth parts of the question. Sartre pulled our attentionto a different epistemological problem with the story.He questioned the authenticity or reliability of thesource. How could Abraham be sure that the voicewas of divine origin, rather than of the devil? That isa legitimate question. If there is an Omnipotent andOmniscient God, and if that God wishes tocommunicate His will to humans without any doubt,He should be able to do so. Society will and shouldjudge a person based on the principle of justice. HadAbraham lived today and had he managed to sacrificehis son, according to God's law, as a society weshould hold him responsible for the murder.However, we should remember that the ultimatejudge is God on the Day of Judgment. See [[7:28]].Genesis [[21:1-24]]; [[22:1-19]] tell the story of thesacrifice. Though the Quran does not give the identityof the child, Muslim scholars, perhaps because of abias for the ancestor of the Arabs, to that covetedposition have assigned Ishmael, Abraham's son fromHagar. The Old Testament, though, spells out Isaac,Abraham's son from Sara, the ancestor of theChildren of Israel. However, the story contains someproblems. According to the Bible, when Abrahamattempted to sacrifice his son, his only son wasIshmael who was 13, while his second son Isaac wasnot even born yet (Genesis [[16:16]]; [[17:24]]; [[21:5]]). Thisinformation contradicts the anonymous author of theHebrews [[11:17]]. How can Abraham sacrifice hisonly son\" Isaac, when the younger Isaac was neverAbraham’s only son\"? Biblical scholars try to getaround this problem by claiming that Ishmael was anillegitimate child. Though Genesis [[16:3]] specificallyconsiders Hagar to be Abraham's wife, the followingverses refer to her as a mistress (Genesis [[16:4-9]]).While Genesis [[22:2]] does not even consider the olderIshmael to be Abraham's son, New Testament'sGalatians [[4:22]] writes about Abraham's two sons.Regardless of the relationship between Abraham andHagar, blaming or demeaning a child because of hisbeing born from a slave is an unjust discrimination.Even if the Biblical slander on Abraham'sextramarital affair was true, holding an innocent childresponsible for the sins of his parents is unjust bothaccording to the Old Testament, Ezekiel [[18:20]], andthe Quran [[6:64]]."

Thecomplaint and his reaction to it might have remindedhim of his own greed and injustice against others. Orperhaps, after making the judgment, he realized thathe reached a verdict without listening to the otherparty. Justice cannot be adjudicated in an ex partehearing. The plaintiff might be distorting or hidingsome facts pertinent to the case. Even if we approachthe case in terms of social justice, hearing thedefendant is still important. For instance, the plaintiffin this case could have been the owner of vast lands,vineyards and farms, while the entire wealth of theother party could have been no more than a hundredsheep.The Quran mentions David's name 16 times anddescribes him in very positive words. He was blessedby God ([[17:55]]; [[21:79]]; [[34:10]]), knowledgeable([[27:15]]), resourceful and obedient ([[38:17]]), caring andjust ([[38:22-26]]).The Old Testament in 2 Samuel [[12:1-14]] tells asimilar story about David with variable details. TheBible describes David as a good-looking young man(1 Samuel [[17:25]]) and praises his intelligence andcourage (1 Samuel [[17:1-58]]), at age thirty he becomesking by divine direction (2 Samuel [[2:1-4]]), and aftersome internal fights, finally becomes king over all ofIsrael (2 Samuel [[4:1-12]]; [[5:1-5]]; 1 Chronicles [[11:1-3]]),brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (Psalms[[24:1-10]]), and extends his kingdom after fighting aseries of wars and committing numerous massacres ina vast territory (2 Samuel [[8:1-18]]; [[8:3-13]]; [[10:1-19]];[[18:7-27]]; [[19:31]]; [[21:11]]; [[29:5]]). However, the Bible thatpraises him for wars and bloody conquests, containslengthy stories blaming him for being a sinfulmanipulator (2 Samuel [[11:2-27]]), and a sinful proudman who angered God (2 Samuel [[23:39]]), and havingaffairs with married women (1 Samuel [[25:31-44]]).The Bible then tells us about the reformation ofDavid by depicting him in his last moments as onewith abiding faith and trust in God after his reign offorty years (2 Samuel [[23:1-7]]; 2 Samuel [[5:5]]; 1Corinthians [[3:4]])."

Thistemporal comparison highlights the importance of theecological system on planet earth. The conjunctionbetween fragments in this verse is Wa (and), thusimplying not a sequence of separate events, butoverlapping series of events. See [[7:69]]; [[25:59]]; [[32:4]];[[50:38]]; [[57:4]].Though the Bible contains some of the originalrevelations, Ezra and other Jewish scholars insertedinto it many of their misunderstandings, comments,desires and ignorance ([[2:59]]). The Biblical account ofthe creation of the universe does not match scientificevidence. For instance, Genesis [[1:1-2]] informs us thatthe first stage of the universe started with the creationof water. Another example of external inconsistencyis the creation of plants on earth before the creationof the sun (Genesis [[1:11-14]]).The order of creation in the Bible is given in detail inits first book, which partially contradicts modernscientific findings: First day, light and darkness(Genesis [[1:3-5]]), Second day, atmosphere, and waters(Genesis [[1:6-8]]), Third day, land and making itfruitful (Genesis [[1:9-13]]), Fourth day, sun, moon, andstars (Genesis [[1:14-19]]), Fifth day, birds, insects, andfishes (Genesis [[1:20-23]]), Sixth day, land animals,and man (Genesis [[1:24,28]]).The Bible also contains internal inconsistencies. Forinstance, a comparative reading of chapter 1 andchapter 2 of Genesis will show that, most likely, thetwo chapters were authored by at least two differentpeople who had different ideas about how theuniverse was created. Only through scientificevidence, which supports the Quranic version ofcreation, can we sort out the discrepancies in theBible. Trees were created before man was (Genesis[[1:11-12,26-27]]) versus man was created before treeswere (Genesis [[2:4-9]]). Birds were created before manwas (Genesis [[1:11-12]], 26-27) versus man was createdbefore birds were (Genesis [[2:7,19]]). Animals werecreated before man was (Genesis [[1:24-27]]) versusman was created before animals were (Genesis[[2:7,19]])."

About thirtyyears after the departure of Muhammad, polytheistsabandoned the election system and established amonarchy or sultanate. Their puppet clerics tried todistort the application of this verse by claiming thatconsultation to elect a leader was not recommendedbut the leader, that is, the self-appointed tyrant,should consult. Unfortunately, this travesty of logicbecame the mainstream view of the followers ofhadith and sunna. Ironically, neither the prophet norhis closest companions imposed themselves by self-appointment or by resorting to a glorious or royalgenealogy. Those who split hairs to mimic everyaspect of life attributed to Muhammad and hiscompanions, from bathroom etiquette to how togroom one's beard, ignored this most importantQuranic instruction that was practiced byMuhammad, and his companions for more than 40years, starting from the immigration to Yathrib andcontinuing with Abu Bakr, Omar, Uthman and Ali,an era called the Khulafa-i Rashideen, that is, GuidedCaliphs.The later satanic Caliphs, assuming the blasphemoustitles of \"God's Caliph (successor)\" or \"God's Shadowon Earth\" for centuries committed numerousatrocities in the name of God until 1924, when thecaliphate was abolished by a young turk, MustafaKemal Atatürk. Democracy practiced according tothe separation of powers is not perfect, but it is thebest system we have discovered so far. As long as thedemocratic procedure is not corrupted by the moneyfrom interest groups or corporations, democracyhelps the majority to pursue its self-interest, whichultimately is forced to include individual rights andthe interests of minorities.Ottoman Caliphs prohibited the importation and useof the printing machine based on the religious fatwaof a sheikh al-islam (highest cleric within theOttoman Empire) who prohibited the use of theprinting machine from 1455 to 1727, for 272 years,for 100,000 precious days, in a vast land stretchingfrom North Africa to Iran, from today's Turkey to theArabian Peninsula. While Europe indulged inlearning God's signs in nature, shared the knowledgevia printing machines, and was rewarded by Godwith a renaissance, reform, technology, andprosperity, Ottomans devolved and sunk further inignorance. While Europeans engaged inphilosophical arguments, the Ottomans recited theholy book no better than a parrot, the book thathighlighted the importance of learning, questioning,discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge. Theymarveled at handwritten books of hearsay andsuperstition, at the lousy arguments developed byGhazzali, who with the full support of a king, aimedto banish philosophy. While Europe sought a bettersystem to save themselves from the tyranny of kingsand the Church, the Ottomans recited handwrittenpoems to praise their corrupt kings and idols. Nowonder why the land, the name, the face, and thereligion of the children of this population is nowassociated with backwardness, ignorance, oppression,violence, and poverty.Federal democracies facilitate cooperation amongdiverse groups with different religions, cultures, andlegal systems and provide common ground for aproductive, peaceful, and freely co-existing society."

The Salafi movement startedwith Ibn Taymiyya, a charismatic scholar whorejected some major tenets of orthodox teachings.Orthodox Sunni sects promote blindly following thefatwas or jurisprudence of a particular sect anddiscourage from interpreting and inferring directlyfrom hadith. Ibn Taymiyya argued that every Muslimmust have direct access to hadith books and learntheir religion through studying them, rather thanbeing bound by the views of earlier scholars. ThoughSalafis justifiably rejected many polytheisticteachings and rituals, such as sectarian jurisprudence,intercession and imploring shrines, theyunfortunately indulged in fabricated hadith, andadvocated a narrow (mis)understanding of the Quran,such as rejecting the use of metaphors. Since, they sethadith sources as partners with God in practicingIslam, they ended up with a religion that reflected aconcoction of Arabic, Jewish and Christian culturefrom medieval times. The majority of salafis live inSaudi Arabia and they promote a Taliban-styletyrannical system that produces an ignorant,misogynistic and backward crowd who subjectthemselves to being herded like sheep by the moralpolice. As we noted in relation to the words hadith,sunna, and ijma, the word salaf too has negativeconnotations in the Quran.

Whenevaluated together with verse [[31:14]] suggesting thetime of breastfeeding as 24 months, it takes simplearithmetic to learn that the pregnancy of the person(nafs) to be 6 months. It is common knowledge thatpregnancy is longer than that. We know from modernembryology that the exact time for a normalpregnancy is 266 days (see [[77:23]]). There is extrainformation to be extracted from these natural andscriptural signs. If we subtract the 6 months, that is180 days, from 266 days, we get 86 days. We caneasily infer that the Quran does not accept thecreature inside the womb to be a person (nafs) fromthe time of conception until the 86th day ofpregnancy. Other verses support our inference. Forinstance, verse [[22:5]] and [[23:14]], which explain theevolution of the human being in four stages, does notuse the word person (nafs) or human (insan) todescribe the early stages of pregnancy. The fourstages of pregnancy are (1) sperm; (2) embryo; (3)about four inch fetus (4) a new creature. It is clearthat a new creation comes into existence after the 86thday. In other words, the emergence ofconsciousness/personhood (nafs) starts taking placein the brain of the fetus approximately three monthsafter conception.

The rootRaQaBa means observe, guard, control, respect, waitfor, tie by the neck, warn, fear. \"Riqab\" means slave,prisoner of war, since they are controlled or guarded.Even if one of the meanings of the word riqab wereneck, we would still reject the traditional translation,for the obvious reason: The verse continues byinstructing muslims regarding the capture of theenemies and the treatment of prisoners of war. If theywere supposed to be beheaded, there would not be aneed for an instruction regarding captives, which is avery humanitarian instruction. Unfortunately, theSunni and Shiite terrorists have used the traditionalmistranslation, and abused it further by beheadinghostages in their fight against their counterpartterrorists, Crusaders and their allied coalition, whotorture and kill innocent people in even biggernumbers, yet in a baptized fashion that is somehowdepicted as non-barbaric by their culture and media.The Quran gives two options regarding the hostagesor prisoners of war before the war ends: (1) set themfree; or (2) release them to get a fee for theirunjustified aggression. Considering the context of theverse and emphasis on capturing the enemy, we couldhave translated the segment under discussion as, \"aimto take captives.\"The Old Testament contains many scenes ofbeheadings and grotesque massacres.

      "1": "Followers of hadith and sunna claim thatGod is represented by the Quran, and the messengeris represented by his opinions on the Quran. Thus,they claim that the Quran is not enough for salvation.Some people may not utter this claimstraightforwardly. They may even claim that theQuran is complete and enough for our guidance.However, further questioning will reveal that theirquran is not \"the Quran.\" The Quran is the one thatconsists of 114 Chapters and 6346 verses. It is amathematically coded book. However, their mindsare confused, and their quran is contaminated withhuman speculations and limited by a snapshotinterpretation. They try to scare the believers bysaying \"you do not like the messenger.\" The beliefthat God is represented by the Quran, and themessenger by his teaching is a satanic claim. Thereare several points to remember:<ul> <li>Quran represents God and His messenger.</li><li>Obeying the Quran is obeying God and the messenger.</li><li>Quran never says: \"Obey God and Moses,\" or \"Obey God and Muhammad.\" Rather, Quran consistently states: \"Obey God and the messenger.\" This is because the word messenger (rasul) comes from the \"message\" (risala). The message is entirely from God; messengers cannot exist without the message.</li><li>Messengers, as humans, make mistakes. Thus, when believers made a covenant with prophet Muhammad they promised to obey him conditionally, i.e., his righteous orders ([[60:12]]).Moreover, God specifically orders Muhammad to consult the believers around him ([[3:159]]). If nobody can object to the personal decision of the messenger, then consultation is meaningless. However, whenever the final decision is made, it should be followed.</li><li>During their lifetimes, messengers are community leaders. In this regard, messengers are not different than the believers who are in charge ([[4:59]]); both should be obeyed. But, this obedience is not absolute. It is open to consultation and discussion.</li><li>The position of messengers is different during their lives; they are interactive teachers and curious students as well. We have the chance to ask them further questions, discuss issues, learn their intentions, and even correct their mistakes. On the other hand, they have the opportunity to correct our misunderstandings. However, when they pass away, their teaching becomes frozen and looses its advancing three-dimensional character. The frozen, snap-shot fragments of knowledge are a dangerous weapon in the hands of ignorant people, to stop God's teachings. They defend every plain error in the name of the messenger. They insult every sincere student of God's revelation.</li></ul>We reject Hadith because we respect Muhammad.No sound person would like to have people bornseveral centuries after him roam the earth and collecthearsay attributed to him. Besides, if Muhammad andhis supporters really believed that the Quran was notsufficient for guidance, or an ambiguous book, orlacked details, then, surely they would have been thefirst ones to write the hadith down and collect themin books. After all, their numbers were in thehundreds of thousands and they had plenty of wealth.They could afford some ink, papyrus paper or leather,and some brain cells, for such an important task.They would not leave it to a guy from farawayBukhara or his ilk, more than two hundred yearslater, to collect hadiths in a land soaked with bloodbecause of sectarian wars. Additionally, Muhammadhad many unemployed or handicapped people aroundwho would gladly volunteer for such a mission. Toexplain away this 200-year this gap in history, thetraditionalists created an absurd fabricated excuse forprophet Muhammad and his supporters. Supposedly,Muhammad and his followers feared that peoplewould mix the Quran with hadiths. This is nonsense.They were smart enough to distinguish both, andthere were enough people to keep track of them.Besides, it is the followers of hadith and sunnathemselves who claim that the Quran was a \"literarymiracle.\" If their claim of \"literary miracle\" weretrue, then it would be much easier to separate theverses of the Quran from hadith. Let's assume thatthey could not really distinguish the text of the Quranfrom Muhammad's words, then couldn't they simplymark the pages of the scripture with the letter Q forthe Quran and letter H for Hadith, or let some recordonly the Quran, or simply color code their covers? Orallocate leather for the Quran and paper for hadith, orvice versa? They could find many ways to keepdifferent books separate from each other. They didnot need to study rocket science or have computertechnology to accomplish that primitive task. Thecollectors of hadiths wished that people would accepttheir assertion that Muhammad and his supporters didnot have ink, paper or leather, minds, and awillingness to collect hadith before them. It is nowonder they even fabricated a few hadiths claimingthat Muhammad's companions were competing withdogs for bones to write the verses of the Quran on!Most likely, Muhammad feared that people wouldmix his words with the Quran. Not in the primitiveway that is claimed by the Sunnis and Shiites, sinceas we pointed out, there were many ways to eliminatethat concern. But the real concern of Muhammad wasdifferent. Because of the warnings of the Quran, hefeared that muslims would follow the footsteps ofJews and would create their own Mishna, Gomorra,and Talmud: hadith would be considered to be anauthority, as another source besides the Quran,setting him up as a partner with God! Ironically, thefollowers of hadith and sunna accomplished exactlythat. They did not need to publish the text of hadithtogether with the Quran--though they have done thatin many commentaries--because have been doingworse. Though they usually have kept hadith separatefrom the Quran physically, when it comes topurposes of guidance and religious authority, theymix it with the Quran. Even worse, they make theunderstanding of the Quran dependent on theunderstanding of hadith, thereby elevating hadith to aposition of authority over the Quran. Thus, if indeedMuhammad was worried about people mixing hiswords with the Quran, the followers of hadith provedhis worries right: centuries after him, not only didthey mix his words with the Quran, but also mixedthousands of fabrications and nonsense attributed tohim. See [[25:30]]; [[59:7]]."

      "2": "Centuries after Muhammad, he and hiscompanions became idols. Muslims startedconsidering the prophet's companions (sahaba) oranyone who met him as a Muslim, to be almostinfallible. The word Saheb, Sahaba, and its pluralAshab are usually used in a negative context. Forinstance, out of the 77 occurrence of Ashab, and oneoccurrence of \"Ashabahum\" (their comrades), only27 are used positively, such as, \"Ashab ul-Jannah\"(People of the Paradise) or \"Ashab ul-Yameen\"(People of the Right). Excluding the few neutralusages of the word, the word \"Ashab\" is usually usedto denote disbelievers and hypocrites. None of theseAshab, the PLURAL of Sahaba, refers to muslimswho lived during time of prophet Muhammad. Inonly one case, the plural Ashab refers to people withMoses ([[26:61]]), and we learn from the Quran thatmost of them were not true believers ([[7:138-178]];[[20:83-87]]).The Quran informs us about the quality ofMuhammad's comrades in numerous verses. What wesee is not a depiction of perfect holy people, butordinary people, with all sorts of weaknesses andshortcomings.Among the 12 occurrences of the singular and dualform, sahib, only five describe a relationship betweena prophet and his friends. And, out of these fiveoccurrences, only one of them has a positiveconnotation. Before quoting the verses, I want toremind you that the word sahib (companion, friend)is about a mutual relationship; if someone is yourcompanion, you are their companion too, and viceversa. In four occurrences, the addressees aredisbelievers or polytheists ([[34:46]], [[53:2]], [[81:22]];[[12:39]]). The only positive usage of the word sahib, asa companion of a prophet is in [[9:40]].In sum, according to the Quranic terminology, thewords sahib (companion, friend), or ashab,(companions, friends) by themselves do not denoteany positive meaning. In three verses, Muhammad isdescribed as the sahib (companion) of disbelievers,and in only one verse, he was the sahib of a believer.Thus, statistically speaking, the word ashab refers tohypocrites and polytheists 75% of the time.According to the books of hadith, Abdullah IbnMasood was one of the top companions of theprophet Muhammad. His hadith narrations are amongSunni Muslims’ most cherished sources ofjurisprudence. Many hadith and narration books,including Bukhary and Ibn Hanbal, report that IbnMasood had a personal copy of the Quran and that hedid not put the last two chapters in it. According tothose books, he claimed that those two chapters didnot belong in the Quran.Apparently, another companion of the prophet,Ubayy Ibn Kaab, also had a different personal Quran.He added two chapters called \"Sura Al-Hafd\" and\"Sura Al-Khal,\" and claimed that these were from theQuran (These \"chapters\" are still being recited byHanafis in the \"sala al-witr,\" after night prayers.)For the prophecy of the Quran regarding the wordshadith, sunna, ijma, sharia, and salaf, see [[33:38]]."

It states that \"the Quran isfrom Him.\" It is not Muhammad's personal claim; itis a divine statement. Therefore, claiming that thepronoun \"it\" in the verse [[53:4]] refers to the words ofMuhammad, not of God, is an obvious distortion.According to the above verse, \"it\" is revelation,without exception. This can be valid only for theQuran. It is nonsense to claim that Muhammad's dailyconversation was entirely revelation. For example,God firmly criticizes Muhammad's words to Zayd([[33:37]]). Obviously, the criticism was not aboutrevelation. The beginning phrase of Chapter 97informs us about the revelation of the Quran: \"Werevealed it in the Night of Destiny.\" The \"it\" in thisverse is the same as the \"it\" in [[53:4]]. . ."

If therewere such an astronomical event, many people fromChina to Africa would have noticed and recorded it.Besides, this traditional interpretation contradicts theQuran, which specifically limits the signs given toMuhammad to be the signs contained in the Quranalone ([[29:50-51]]). The splitting of the Moon wasfulfilled when Apollo 11 landed on the Moon andastronauts took some rocks from the Moon back toearth in July 1969.

Why among hundreds of versesdescribing the Quran, has the convention decided onthese verses? Out of more than 50 descriptive noun-adjectives used for the Quran, why would they pick\"Karym\" (Honorable)? Al-Quran il-Karym? Why notmore frequently used words such as Zikr (Message),Hakym (Wise), Mubyn (Clear), Nur (Light), insteadof Karym? Why is this verse highlighted inconnection to the Quran? Why not, for instance, theverses repeatedly reminding us of the easy-to-understand language of the Quran ([[54:17,22,32,40]])?Or, why not one of these verses: [[12:111]]; [[15:1]]; [[17:9]];[[17:88]]; [[17:89]]; [[30:58]]; [[41:3]]; [[55:2]] . . .?We have all the reason to be suspicious of theintention of those who dedicated Chapter 36 (Ya Sin)to be recited in funerals for the DEAD, the chapterthat contains the only verse declaring that the Quranis sent to remind the LIVING beings ([[36:70]])! Wehave all the reason to be suspicious of the intention ofthose who picked the name hadith, a negative wordwhen used for hearsay narrations and teachings otherthan the Quran, to depict another source besides theQuran! So, why did they pick the word \"Karym\" asthe most common adjective for the Quran and verses[[56:77-79]] as the most common subtitle for the coversof manuscripts?Those who appreciate the Quran know the answer tothe question very well: The polytheistic clergymenand scholars who betrayed the Quran, reached aconsensus in not understanding or misunderstanding[[56:77-79]], and they thought they could repel othersfrom the Quran according to their misunderstanding.They distorted the meaning of these verses byclaiming that those who do not have ablution,including the women who they considered \"dirty\"because of menstruation, should not touch the Quran.Now we may infer why the verse whose meaning hasbeen distorted by consensus is picked for the cover ofthe Quran manuscripts. Now we may infer why theadjective mentioned in that verse was made the mostpopular adjective of the Quran. We believe that thisis a part of a diabolic conspiracy to prevent the Quranfrom becoming a pocket book, a book of quickreference; they keep the Quran on high shelves ornail it on high walls far away from people’s reachUnfortunately, this plan has worked successfully. TheQuran has been transformed from being a guide, areference book, a map, a compass, into a dangerousobject, like a train, like a high-voltage transformerstation! When the Quran becomes a book too-difficult-to-understand, making it impossible to reachits \"high\" meanings, and dangerous to touch, thenrush in volumes of hadiths, loads of sunna, barrels ofhearsay, mishmash heaps of sectarian teachings, pilesof nonsense, tons of superstitions, hordes of holymen, and troops of holy merchants. This explains themisery, backwardness, oppression, repression,division, and corruption rampant in the so-called\"Muslim countries.\"The unappreciative people who deem the Quraninsufficient, because of their prejudice, are notpermitted to understand the Quran ([[6:110]]; [[17:45]];[[18:57]]). It is interesting that those who do not acceptthe Quran as the sole authority do not understand thevery verses about understanding the Quran. Thus,[[7:3]]; [[17:46]]; [[41:44]]; [[56:79]] are delicious art work thatfunction both as the \"thesis and the evidence.\""

      "2": "Proving the existence of free will isphilosophically and scientifically impossible.Considering Gödel's incompleteness theorem, it isimpossible to eliminate axioms in axiomaticdeductions. The assertion, \"I have freedom of will\" isnot only nonfalsifiable, but also contradicts thedeterministic laws governing matter and energy. AsNietzsche and Blanchard argued, it might beimpossible to predict the interactive motion ofhundreds of billiard balls, yet the motion of each balldepends on the mass and velocity of the ball collidingit. The motion of all balls depends on the motion ofthe first ball, and its motion depends on the angle andkinetic energy of the cue, which passes it to the ballsduring the impact. Sartre and other atheisticexistentialists assumed the existence of freedom ofwill by asserting that \"existence preceded essence\"yet they never explained why one egg ended up witha snake while another with a bird; they ignored thefact that there could not be existence without essence.Nevertheless, if there is freedom of will, it cannot bepossible without an omnipotent, the greatest paradox-solver God. Without God, there is no justification forbelieving in one's freedom in a world where everyatom and molecule works in a deterministic way.Does the human brain function according to the lawsgoverning quarks? So far, there is no scientificevidence showing such a relationship. Muslimscannot be accused of being fatalistic; to the contrary,freedom of will is only possible with the existence ofGod, and muslims can only be accused of believingin freedom of will. See [[6:110]]; [[7:15,30]]; [[13:11]]; [[18:29]];[[42:13,48]]; [[46:15]]; [[57:22]].However, acceptance of freedom of will based ondivine communication creates other logical problemsor paradoxes. Leaving aside the uncertainty principleand speculations related to quantum physics, it seemsimpossible to assert the freedom of an agent who didnot even choose his or her genetic makeup, the time,the space, and the conditions where he or she wouldbe born. Obviously, this is a paradox, since it isimpossible to choose existence or the qualities ofexistence without having an existence or the qualitiesfor choosing qualities! In other words, the paradox offreedom of will is triggered at the moment ofcreation. Did God ask us whether to give us freedomof will and subject us to a test? If yes, then how couldwe have the freedom to choose or reject freedom, ifwe did not have it in the first place? If no, then, howcan we have freedom of will, while we were forced tohave it in the first place?Though believing that we humans have freedom ofwill is one of the paradoxes most difficult to digest, Iacknowledge it because of the proven book ([[18:29]];[[57:22]]).God, as a demonstration of His creative powers,chose to test the results of creating a being with theability to freely choose its own destiny ([[18:29]]; [[6:110]];[[13:11]]). God downloaded Hisrevelation/information/logic (ruh) to the prototypicalhuman that would provide him with innate rules ofreasoning to distinguish falsehood from truth, badfrom good ([[15:29]]; [[32:9]]; [[38:72]];). Messengers andbooks containing ruh were only a bonus mercy, merereminders of the facts that could be discovered byreason ([[2:37-38]]; [[10:57]]; [[11:17]]; [[16:89]]; [[21:107]]; [[29:51]];[[16:2]]; [[36:69]]; [[37:87]]; [[39:21]]; [[42:52]]; [[58:22]]). After thetwo human prototypes failed the first test ([[2:11-27]]),God created life and death on this planet to giveanother chance, to reform ourselves, this timesubjecting billions of individuals inheriting andoperating the same basic program to the same test([[67:2]]). After letting the program run for a period, anindividual is deemed accountable to God ([[46:15]]).God decided to punish those who freely choose apath contradictory to its original program as theycorrupt it through false ideas and actions ([[2:57]];[[4:107]]; [[6:12,20,26,110]]; [[7:9,30,53,177]]; [[59:19]]). Theprograms that are infected with viruses willexperience a regretful stage in a quarantine calledHell (Hell and Paradise are allegories: [[13:35]]; [[17:60]];[[37:62-64]]; [[7:44-50]]). In this stage the corrupt programsand their chief infector (Satan) will be penalized([[7:11-27]]; [[38:71-88]]), and then they will altogether beannihilated there ([[87:13]]). The only virus that will notbe healed on the day of Judgment is the virus thatcreates a schizophrenic personality, a personality thatsubmits itself to others besides God, a personalitythat does not free itself from false gods therebyalienating itself from its origin, that is God([[4:48,116]])."

    "r": {
      "3": "This chapter, which mentions the qualitiesof iron provides some interesting informationregarding the physical structure of the element, whichin the 1980's led me to write a booklet on it. Since itis the only chapter elaborating on the benefits andharms of iron, the chapter is called Sura al-Hadid,that is, Chapter Iron.We know that during the era of Quranic revelation,Arabs were not using the so-called Arabic numerals.They adopted those numerals about two centuriesafter Muhammad. During the time of Muhammad,Arabs were using their Alphabet letters as numbers.The 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet then wasarranged in a different order that started with theletters ABJD, thus known as Abjad, or Gematria.Since Arabic and Hebrew are closely relatedlanguages, their numerical system too resembled eachother. Each letter corresponded to a number, such asA for 1, B for 2, J for 3, D for 4. When it reached 10,the corresponding numerical values would continueas multiples of tens and when reaching 100, theywould continue as multiples of hundred ending with1000. Archeological evidence shows that then theywere distinguishing letters from numbers by usingdifferent color ink or simply by putting a line overthe letter, resembling the Roman numerals. However,a literary text might use letters/numbers for multiplepurposes; that is for both their semantic or lexiconfunction and at the same time for their numericalvalue. Such a multi-use requires an extremecommand and knowledge of language and the authoris limited by the language. When Arabs abandonedthe Abjad system, it was still used by poets andcharlatan healers who wished to take advantage of anantiquated numerical system that became a curiosityfor the gullible. Poets wrote verses about events orepithets for important figures, with the date of theevent or the death embedded in the numerical valuesof the letters of a word or a phrase in their verses.The usage of the Abjad in the Quran is extensive,impressive and prophetic (For another example see[[74:1-2]]).When we add up the numerical values of letterscomprising the word HaDYD (iron), it gives theatomic number of any iron element: 8+4+10+4=26. Ifwe add up the numerical values of the letterscomprising the word AL-HaDYD (the iron, or aparticular version of iron), it gives the atomic weightof a particular isotope of the iron element:1+30+8+4+10+4=57. Of course, this interestingcoincidence has nothing to do with the Quran, sincethe word HaDYD already existed in the language ofcommon people, including the opponents of theQuran. However, when we study the details of thischapter we will learn that the author of the book wasaware of the unique relationship between this word,its numerical values, and the related physical orchemical properties.This chapter is listed as the 57th chapter of the Quran,corresponding to the numerical value of its popularname, and at the same time corresponding to theatomic weight of a particular isotope of iron. Iron hasfive isotopes, with the atomic number of 54, 55, 56,57, and 58, containing 29, 30, 31, and 32 neutrons,respectively. We also observe that the only versementioning the physical properties of iron is listed asthe 26th verse, including the unnumbered verse,Bismillah, in the beginning of chapter. (Bismillah, asthe first and the most repeated verse of the Quran hasa unique role in the mathematical structure of theQuran). The chapter contains 29 numbered versesand 30 verses, when you include Bismillah; eachnumber giving us the number of neutrons of differentisotopes of iron. Iron with 30 neutrons has the moststable nucleus possible, and thus cannot be subjectedto fission or fusion. Formation of iron marks theformation of planets and death of stars. Iron with 31neutrons has a nuclear spin and is used in industry.The word God occurs 32 times in the chapter, two ofthem in the verse mentioning iron. Thus, the verseabout the iron contains the 26th occurrence of theword God, with or without including the unnumberedBismillah. The verb \"we sent down\" is interesting,since it describes the formation of planets."

But it was not this way fromthe beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces hiswife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marriesanother woman commits adultery.' The disciples saidto him, 'If this is the situation between a husband andwife, it is better not to marry.' Jesus replied, 'Noteveryone can accept this word, but only those towhom it has been given. For some are eunuchsbecause they were born that way; others were madethat way by men; and others have renouncedmarriage--because of the kingdom of heaven. Theone who can accept this should accept it'\" (Matthew[[19:8-12]]). \"These are they which were not defiledwith women; for they are virgins\" (Revelation[[14:4]]). St. Paul, the voice behind the Gospels of theNicene Conference, praised hermitic life: \"Now forthe matters you wrote about: It is good for a man notto marry\" (1 Corinthians [[7:1]]).Today, only the Catholic Church and some smallsects are struggling to keep this innovation alive.However, as the Quran states, they do not followtheir own fabricated practice of celibacy. Worse, theirchurches have become notorious for pedophilia andchild abuse, and many rich churches have recentlydeclared bankruptcy because of a series of litigationsby abused children. The unnatural religiousinnovation in the name of God, led many priests toengage in child abuse and sodomy, perhaps attractinghomosexuals to the ranks of priesthood for variousreasons. Some religious men with homosexualtendencies who thought celibacy to be a cure for theirdesires ended up getting more opportunity to spendtime with altar boys in their churches. Perhaps somehomosexuals picked the profession just to indulge intheir perverted act behind holy curtains. In 2004, theConference of Catholic Bishops found 11,000 casesof sexual abuse by about 4,000 priests and deaconssince 1950. The real numbers are most likely muchhigher. The sex-abuse lawsuits cost the Churchbillions of dollars in compansation, leading somedioceses to financial bankruptcy. The moralbankruptcy and perversion, however, was going onfor centuries and was kept a \"holy secret\" by thepowerful and secretive Church. It is only in the lastdecades that children have more of a voice, and theChurch's financial and social power to keep the evildeeds of its priests as secrets behind the confessionsession is weakening. The Catholic Church, which isalso having problems in recruiting priests, is in adilemma. If they adhere to their centuries-oldcelebrated rule, then they will continue sufferingfrom the perverted behavior of priests and a shortageof new recruits. If they amend their rules andabandon the practice, then their credibility and claimof infallibility will get hurt, again. If history is aguide, the Church will resist until reality will forcethem to abandon it. They will always find a way tojustify their blunder to their faithful, who considerreason and religion to be like ice and fire, with theireternally \"infallible\" teachings of their Popes! Thepopes who not only stole the power of forgiveness,infallibility, the keys of heaven from God, but alsostole the Biblical title of God, \"holy father.\"According to the Quran, the Pope is no different thanPharaoh, since he is claiming divine powers.According to the Quran, Catholics are mentally andspiritually enslaved by their Popes. Isn’t it time toaccept the truth so that truth will set us all free?The Quran encourages man and woman to marry.Sex, as long as it is done within the limit of God'slaw, is considered one of God's great blessings.

They provoked muslimsand the first two tribes were forced to leave the citywith their transportable possessions. However,prophet Muhammad allegedly did not forgive BanuQurayza; their necks were struck and their childrenwere made slaves. Estimates of those killed vary from400 to 900. The Quran refers to the event andcontrary to the claims of hearsay collections, nevermentions killing or enslaving them, which is in directcontradiction to many verses of the Quran. TheQuran, in these verses, informs us that a group from\"The People of the Book\" was forced to leave theterritory because of their violation of the constitutionand secretly organizing war together with theirenemies against muslims ([[59:1-4]]). Verse [[59:3]] clearlystates that they were not penalized further in thisworld.The credibility of the story of Muhammadmassacring Bani Qurayza Jews has been acontroversial subject since the time it was publishedby Ibn Ishaq. Ibn Ishaq, who died in 151 A.H., that is145 years after the event in question, was severelycriticized by his peers for relying on highlyexaggerated Jewish stories. He was also harshlycriticized for presenting forged poetry attributed tofamous poets. Some of his contemporary scholars,such as Malik, called him \"a liar.\" However, his workwas later copied by others without criticalexamination. This is an example of hearsay used bydubious Jewish reporters for propaganda purposes.Modern scholars found astonishing similaritiesbetween Ibn Ishaq and the account of historianJosephus regarding King Alexander, who ruled inJerusalem before Herod the Great, hung upon crosses800 Jewish captives, and slaughtered their wives andchildren before their eyes. Many other similarities inthe details of the story of Banu Qurayza and the eventreported by Josephus are compelling.Besides, the lack of reference or justification in theQuran for such a massacre of great magnitude, andthe verses instructing principles for muslims to abideby removes all credibility from this story ([[35:18]]:[[61:4]]).

      "2": "The Quran clearly warns us against thepower of a few wealthy people, and asks us todistribute the wealth of a nation among its populationin a more egalitarian way. See [[58:12]].Contrary to the political alliance of many clergymenwith the wealthy and the privileged throughouthistory, the Bible too contains many verses protectiveof the weak and poor. \"He upholds the cause of theoppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lordsets prisoners free, the Lord gives sight to the blind,the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lordloves the righteous\" (Psalm [[146:7-8]]). \"Is not this thesort of fast that pleases me: to break unjust fetters, toundo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed gofree, and to break all yokes? Is it not sharing yourfood with the hungry, and sheltering the homelesspoor?\" (Isaiah [[58:6-7]]). \"The Spirit of the LordGOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointedme to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hathsent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaimliberty to the captives, and the opening of the prisonto them that are bound\" (Isaiah [[61:1]]).The following verses from the Bible are veryinstructive today since it rejects unequivocally thedeity of Jesus and the baptizing of Capitalism. \"AsJesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fellon his knees before him. 'Good teacher,' he asked,'what must I do to inherit eternal life?' 'Why do youcall me good?' Jesus answered. 'No one is goodexcept God alone. You know the commandments:'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal,do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honoryour father and mother.'' 'Teacher,' he declared, 'allthese I have kept since I was a boy.' Jesus looked athim and loved him. 'One thing you lack,' he said. 'Go,sell everything you have and give to the poor, andyou will have treasure in heaven. Then come, followme.' At this the man's face fell. He went away sad,because he had great wealth. Jesus looked around andsaid to his disciples, 'How hard it is for the rich toenter the kingdom of God!' The disciples wereamazed at his words. But Jesus said again, 'Children,how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It iseasier for a camel to go through the eye of a needlethan for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.' \"(Mark [[10:17-25]]).Muhammad was both the messenger of God andelected leader of a diverse group in the city-state ofYathrib. As a leader and commander, he had the rightto allocate the spoils of war. The verse does not meanthat Muhammad gave us another book, or a televisionset, or silly stories, or numerous prohibitions; it isabout a specific case, that is, the distribution of spoilsof war. The followers of hadith and sunna, abuse thisverse and take it out of context hoping to justifyvolumes of books containing numerous contradictoryand silly hearsay reports. They want us to believe thatto \"take whatever Muhammad has given\" means totake whatever story Bukhari and his ilk told severalcenturies after Muhammad's departure! See [[49:1]]."

The expression Allahu wahdahu (God alone)occurs in [[7:70]]; [[39:45]]; [[4:12,84]] and [[60:4]]. Thesenumbers add up to 361, or 19x19 and thus itnumerically emphasizes that the main message of theQuran is serving God ALONE. For the same reason,the numerical value of God's attribute WAHiD (One;6+1+8+4) equals 19, the code of the Quran'snumerical structure discovered in 1974. For theimportant role of the number 19, see chapter 74.We may pray for polytheists to attain salvation; butwe cannot ask God to forgive them ([[4:48]], 116).[[060:007-9]] These verses make it clear that war isallowed only in self-defense. See [[9:5,29]]; [[8:19]]; [[47:35]].[[060:010]] We should take a lesson from themeticulous care for the rights of individuals that haveparticipated in war. Returning the dowries paid to thewomen who sought refuge among muslims to thosewho live with the aggressive enemies demonstratesthe highest standard for a peaceful society that putsthe value of justice and peace far above financialgain. It is no wonder Muhammad and his followerssoon conquered the hearts of the entire populationand were able to return peacefully to their hometownas victors. This shows that Muhammad’s mission wasnot to gain more wealth, as some biased critic claim,since women would be encouraged to smuggle asmuch as they can from enemy ranks.[[060:012]] Verse [[60:12]] informs us about the rights andprivileges enjoyed by women in the early muslimcommunity during the life of prophet Muhammad. Inthis verse, the prophet acknowledges women's rightto vote, by taking the pledge of believing women topeacefully surrender themselves to God alone andlead a righteous life. The word \"BaYA'\" used in theverse implies the political nature of the pledge; theyaccepted the leadership of the prophet individually,with their free choice. This verse is not about somepagan or mushrik women embracing islam, but isabout a group of muslim women publicly announcingtheir allegiance to Muhammad, who became afounder of a federally secular constitutionalgovernment in central Arabia. This is a historicaldocument that shows that muslim women were notconsidered default appendices of their decision-making husbands, brothers, fathers or maleguardians, but were rather treated as independentpolitical entities who could vote and enter into socialcontracts with their leaders. Unfortunately, many ofthe human rights recognized by islam were later oneby one taken away from individuals, especially fromwomen, by the leaders of Sunni and Shiite religions.They replaced the progressive and liberating teachingof the Quran and practice of the early muslims withreactionary and enslaving teachings, therebyresurrecting the dogmas and practices of \"the days ofignorance.\" It took humanity centuries to recognizefor women their God-given rights. For instance, theUS recognized the right of women to vote in 1919 bypassing the 19th Amendment. Exactly, 13 centuriesafter it was recognized by the Quran. As for theregion that once led the world in human rights andfreedom, it is now more than 13 centuries behind!After women, the men too lost their dignity to electtheir leaders. What a regression!"

    "r": {
      "1": "The word ahmad is an adjective meaning\"most acclaimed\" or \"most celebrated.\" Traditionalsources consider it a proper name for Muhammad.This contradicts historical facts. The name of theprophet that came after Jesus was Muhammad, whichis used in the Quran four times. Centuries after thedeparture of Muhammad, Muhammad-worshipersfabricated 99 names, including Ahmad, forMuhammad, in order to compete with the attributesof God. They could not accept one God having somany beautiful attributes, with their second godhaving only one attribute, Muhammad. Theyincluded many divine attributes, such as, \"The First,The Last, The Judge..\" in their list for Muhammad.Furthermore, we do not find the word Ahmad in theBible. Rather we see the translation of the Greekadjective, \"paracletos\".\"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give youanother Comforter/Counselor (paracletus), that hemay abide with you for ever\" (John [[14:16]]). Also, seeJohn [[14:26]]; [[15:26]] [[16:7]].Jesus predicted the coming of another prophet. Theone whose coming was foretold by Jesus ismentioned as \"Paracletos\" or \"Periclytos\" in Greekmanuscripts. Paracletos means advocate, comforter,or counselor. Periclytos, on the other hand, means\"admirable one\" (in Arabic ahmad). The \"spirit\" here,does not mean other than human. There are caseswhere the word \"spirit\" is used for humans (2Thessalonians [[2:2]]; 1 John [[4:1-3]]).If indeed Jesus had prophesied the proper name of theprophet after him, this prophecy would have gottenthe attention of almost every one of his supporters.Furthermore, we would see many people among hissupporters and later Christians giving the nameAhmad to their sons, hoping that their sons wouldfulfill the prophecy. But, we do not even see a singleChristian named Ahmad. Therefore, the Aramaic orHebrew equivalent of this word did not become aname. However, the name Muhammad sharing thesame root and similar meaning with the word ahmadis instructive.Bible-thumpers assert that there are more than twothousand prophecies foretelling the coming of theMessiah in the Old Testament. Evidently, this is apreposterous claim. But, an impartial reader will findseveral clear prophecies. Then, the reader may ask,\"What is wrong with Jews? Why don't they see thoseplain prophecies in their book?\"Obviously, this problem is not peculiar to Jews.Whenever a new messenger comes, the bigotedreligious people reject them in the name of previousmessengers. For instance, Egyptians rejected Mosesby claiming that Joseph was the last messenger([[40:28-38]]). Jews rejected (J)esu(s) when he startedhis mission. Those who started worshipingMuhammad too claimed Muhammad to be the lastmessenger, in contradiction to the Quran ([[3:81]]).Christians were and are not different.The Old Testament in Deuteronomy [[18:18]] prophesiesthe coming of Muhammad, since he was more likeMoses and came from among the Arabs, the brethrenof the Children of Israel.\"I will raise them up a Prophet from among theirbrethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in hismouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shallcommand him.\" (Deuteronomy [[18:18]]).Christians try hard to use [[18:18]] as a prophecy aboutJesus, but their fictional \"son of God\" who \"died forthe sins of the world\" is not like Moses; neither is hismiraculous birth, his marital status, nor his politicalpower. However when we compare, we see thatMuhammad is much more like Moses than Jesus was.Besides, the Biblical prophecy does not say \"amongthemselves\" or \"among Children of Israel,\" but\"among their brethren.\" The word brethren is directlyused by the Old Testament to describe therelationship between the family of Isaac and thefamily of Ishmael (See Genesis [[16:12]]; [[25:18]]).The New Testament too contains some cluesregarding the coming prophet, other than theMessiah. John [[1:19-25]] lists the expected threepersons: Christ, Elijah, and That Prophet. Theseverses, if they are not a fabrication of John, provideus with clues that Jewish people were expecting a\"prophet\" besides Christ, a prophet that had beenprophesied in Deuteronomy [[18:18]]. It is not a surprisethat some Christian scholars are using their famousformula, in order to hide this obvious Biblical fact:\"Christ + Elijah + That Prophet = Jesus.\" This isTrinity in Trinity or Pandora's Trinity."

As if God forgot a crucial part ofthe testimony, Sunnis have the audacity to add in thestatement Muhammadun Rasulullah (Muhammad isGod's Messenger). The Shiite faction went even astep further and added Ali Hujjatullah (Ali is God'sArgument). This mentality of adding the names ofidolized creatures next to God has been exposed by[[39:45]]. Verse [[63:1]], is the only verse in the Quran thatcontains the second part of the shahada (testimony).As with the word hadith, sunna, ijma, and sharia([[33:38]]; [[35:43]]; [[42:21]]; [[45:6]]), God knew in advancethat the polytheists would add the name of their idolsnext to His name. Thus, God mentioned the secondpart as the utterance of hypocrites. Modernhypocrites do not really believe that Muhammad wasmerely a messenger since they claim that he was apartner with God in authoring God's religion. Theythink that Muhammad completed where God hadforgotten and that he even abrogated some of theQuranic verses. A messenger of God would never dosuch a thing, since their only mission is to deliverGod's message. Thus, those who add a testimonyabout Muhammad's messengership in the shahada infact are lying in that testimony; the Muhammad intheir mind is no messenger, but rather their imaginarygod besides God."

They distort their meaning as fasters,widows and virgins.\" When the issue is aboutwomen, somehow, the meaning of the Quranic wordspasses trough rapid mutations. For instance, we knowthat the Sunni and Shiite scholars who could not beatcows and examples found it convenient and fair tobeat women (see [[4:34]]). Those of us who haverejected other religious sources besides the Quran arestill struggling to clean our minds from theseinnovations that even have sneaked into the Arabiclanguage long after the revelation of the Quran. Thereis, in fact, nothing whatsoever about fasting, widowsand virgins in this verse. We are rediscovering andrelearning the Quran.The third word from the end of the verse, SaYiHat,which we have translated as \"active in their societies\"simply means to travel or move around for a cause.About two century after the revelation of the Quran,when the rights of women were one by one weretaken through all-male enterprises called hadith,ijtihad and tafseer, Muslim communities foundthemselves thinking and living like the enemies ofIslam in the Days of Ignorance. The misogynisticmind of orthodox commentators and translatorssimply could not fathom the notion of a Muslimwoman traveling around alone to do anything  andso they pretended that the word in question was notSaYaHa, but SsaWM  fasting! Socially activewomen were indeed more difficult to control than thewomen who would fast in their homes; they wereeven less costly, since they would eat less. For theusage of the verb form of the root, see [[9:2]]. The wordSaYaHa has nothing to do with fasting; the Quranconsistently uses the word SaWaMa for fasting([[2:183-196]]; [[4:92]]; [[5:89,90]]; [[19:26]]; [[33:35]]; [[58:4]]).The second word from the end is THaYiBat, whichmeans those who return, or those who areresponsive\". Various derivatives of the same root areused to mean reward\" or refuge\" or cloths\". Forinstance, see [[2:125]]; [[3:195]]. The Arabic words forwidow are ARMiLa or AYaMa. The Quran usesAYaMa for widow or single; see: [[24:32]].The last word of this verse, aBKaR, which meansthose who are \"young,\" \"early risers\" or \"foremost,\"has traditionally, and implausibly, been interpreted as\"virgins\" in this passage. The resulting distortedmeaning of the verse supports a sectarian teachingthat justifies a man marrying more than one virgin.The Arabic word for virgin is BaTuL or ADRa.This false interpretation has become so popular that itis apparently now considered beyond any challenge.Excluding Edip Yuksel's Turkish translation, Mesaj;published in 1999, we have not seen any publishedtranslation that does not duplicate this centuries-olderror.

Forthis commentary, he relies mainly on a hadith fromAbu Dawud (d. 888), one of the so-called authenticSunni holy hadith books:Ibn Abbas told all of you by Wasil b. Abd al-Ala al-Asadi- Muhammad b. Fudayl- al-Amash- abuZabyan- ibn Abbas: the first thing God created is thepen. God then said to it: write!, Whereupon the penasked: what shall I write, my lord! God replied: writewhat is predestined! He continued: and the penproceeded to (write) whatever is predestined andgong to be to the coming of the hour. God then liftedup the water vapor and split the heavens off from it.Then God created the fish (nun), and the earth wasspread out upon its back. The fish became agitated,with the result that the earth was shaken up. It wassteadied by means of the mountains, for they indeedproudly (tower) over the earth.After learning the intellectual level of the \"believers,\"collectors, narrators, and commentators of the abovehadith, such as Abu Dawud (d. 888), al-Tabari (d.1516), and Ibn al-Baz (1995), it becomes clear whyMuhammad would utter the words in [[25:30]].

Hiscomputerized study that started in 1969 gave its fruitsin early 1974 by the discovery of the 14-century-oldSECRET. The discovery of this code opened a newera that has been changing the paradigm of those whodo not turn off the circuits of their brains in mattersrelated to God. This discovery provided verypowerful verifiable and falsifiable evidence for God'sexistence, His communication with us, and thefulfillment of a great prophecy. Besides, it savedmonotheists from the contradiction of trusting pastgenerations regarding the Quran, knowing that theyhave fabricated, narrated and followed volumes ofman-made teachings, demonstrated ignorance,distorted the meaning of the Quranic words, andglorified gullibility and sheepish adherence to thefatwas of clerics.If the Code 19 was going to provide strong evidencefor the existence of God and for the authenticity ofthe Quran, then it is reasonable to expect that theidentity of the discoverer and the time of thediscovery would not be coincidental. Indeed, theevents have demonstrated a prophetic design in thetiming of this miraculous mathematical design.The number 19 is mentioned only in a chapter knownas \"The Hidden,\" the 74th chapter of the Quran.Juxtaposing these two numbers yields 1974, exactlythe year in which the code was deciphered. (Calendarbased on the birth of Jesus and the solar year areaccepted by the Quran as units of calculating time.See, [[19:33]]; [[43:61]]; [[18:24]]. Besides, this is the mostcommonly used calendar in the world.) If wemultiply these two numbers, 19x74, we end up with1406, the exact number of lunar years between therevelation of the Quran and the discovery of the code.In January 31, 1990, Rashad Khalifa was assassinatedin Tucson, Arizona, by a terrorist group affiliatedwith al-Qaida. Ironically, soon after his departure,ignorant people started idolizing him and created acult distorting his message of strict monotheism. AlsoSee [[27:82-85]]; [[40:28-38]]; [[72:19-28]].

Though all commentators knew theprimary meaning of this verse to be \"manifest to allthe people,\" few of them mentioned it in theircommentaries, and most of them chose the alternativemeaning, \"scorching the skin.\" Some, picked amixture and preferred \"scorching humans.\"Commentators who lived in pre-1974 had an excuseto use ‘scorch’ and ‘burn,’ but after the discovery ofthe secret, after the prophecy of this chapter wasunveiled, translators and commentators have noexcuse for repeating the misunderstanding ofprevious generations.We translate the word bashar as \"humans\" whilemany classic commentaries rendered it as \"skin.\" TheQuran uses it invariably for humans. For instance, itused for humans just two verses down, at the end ofverse 31. The word we render as \"manifest\" or\"succeeding tablets/screens,\" is lawaha and theQuran never use it to mean \"scorching,\" \"burning\" or\"shriveling.\" See [[7:145,150,154]]; [[54:13]]; [[75:22]].After learning the discovery of the mathematicalsystem based on the number 19, it takes a blindnessand bigotry in the magnitude of miracle to not see theobvious meaning and implication of this verse. Thosewho assert that the only response the Lord of theUniverse could give to a skeptic who challenged theauthenticity of His word is to tell such a skeptic, \"Iwill throw you in fire and scorch you!\", do notappreciate God as He should be appreciated. Thesepeople can accept a God who can produce the bestliterary work, but they cannot accept Him as theultimate mathematician and advocate.

In fact, you do notneed to read that book to witness the great miracle foryourself. All you need is to hear that the literal andnumeral units of the Quran are designed according toa mathematical system based on code 19. If you doyour research objectively, with a critical mind, youwill discover many features that already have beendiscovered and witnessed by many. You should alsobe informed about two extreme reactions and groups.The majority of the followers of hadith and sunnahave a great allergy and aversion against this number.Their blood pressure goes up when they hear thenumber 19. They are quick in repeating excuses, orfalse claims made by their scholars. Another group,however, entails the manipulators and innumerateswho are too gullible and too eager to discover evenmore examples. They are somehow impressed by thepattern of 19 in the Quran, but because of their lackof comprehension of the laws of probability and solidbase in mathematics, they juggle with numbers in anarbitrary and anecdotal fashion and come up withmany so-called miracles.A careful and objective reader will notice that shortverses build and prepare the reader to verse [[74:30]] andthe verses afterwards describe the function of thenumber 19 and the reaction of people to it. Verse[[74:30]] is the longest verse in the Quran in proportionto the average length of verses in the chapters theybelong. The reader, at the start, encounters \"thehidden one\" and is informed about a typical profile ofan arrogant and ignorant antagonist with a fast pacedseries of short descriptions that lead to a question andan enigmatic answer in [[74:30]]. The enigma isdescribed in cryptic, yet prophetic words of in [[74:31]].Later, following a powerful emphasis on theimportance of the prophecy, verse [[74:37]] describesthose who would witness the prophetic fulfillment ofthese verses as \"progressive\" and depicts those whodeprive themselves from such a blessing as\"regressive\" people. The rest of the chapter elaborateson the characteristics of two groups and connectsthem to their reaction to the prophetic message(ZiKRa).Many verses of the Quran implicitly or explicitlyrefer to this prophetic event that will be witnessedonly by those who are appreciative. For instance, see[[1:1]]; [[2:2]]; [[2:118]]; [[6:4-5]]; [[6:25-26]]; [[6:67]]; [[6:104]]; [[6:158]];[[7:146]]; [[10:1]]; [[10:20]]; [[12:1]]; [[13:1]]; [[13:38-40]]; [[15:1]]; [[15:9]];[[17:88-96]]; [[20:133-135]]; [[25:4-6]]; [[26:1-6]]; [[27:1]]; [[27:82]]-85; [[27:93]]; [[28:1-2]]; [[29:1-2]]; [[29:50-52]]; [[31:1-2]]; [[38:1-8]];[[38:29]]; [[38:87-88]]; [[40:44]]; [[40:78-83]]; [[41:53]]; [[46:10]];[[54:1-5]]; [[59:21]]; [[72:28]]; [[78:27-30]]; [[83:7-21]]; [[98:4]].

Thoughthe roundness of the earth was known byphilosophers before the revelation of the Quran,ordinary people did not find it a reasonable orcommon-sense fact. Therefore, almost all thecommentators of the Quran tried to interpret the wordso that they could save their flat earth from beingcurved. They reasoned that the verse must be anallegorical description, that God must have meant thenest or the place of the egg from the word egg. So,they translated this verse as follows: \"and after thatHe spread the earth\"!Abd al-Aziz bin Baz was the chief cleric of SaudiArabia, the head of the Council of Senior ReligiousScholars for three decades. He had a great impact onregressive and oppressive laws in Saudi Arabia,including the ban on women's driving. A bookauthored by Bin Baz was published in 1975 carriedthe following title: \"Scientific and NarrativeEvidence for that the Earth is Fixed, the Sun isMoving and it is Possible to Go to the Planets.\" Thebook was not published by any publishing house; itwas published by none other than the IslamicUniversity of Medina. In that book, Bin Bazcomplains about a new heresy; he is saddened to see,well more accurately, hear, people talking about themotion of the earth and he wants to put a stop to thatheresy. In page 23, Bin Baz after listing somehadiths, issues a fatwa, asserting that those whobelieve that the earth is rotating are kafirs(disbelievers), and if they were Muslims before, theybecame apostates. The Saudi Sunni leader does notstop there and explains the ramification of the fatwa:any Muslim believing in the rotation of the earthloses his or her right to life and property; they shouldbe killed! This same cleric was the head of aninternational conference of Sunni scholarsrepresenting 38 countries discussing the SalmanRushdi affair. Then, Saudi Arabia was competingwith Iran regarding leadership in the Islamic worldand this was the hot issue. The conference issued aunanimous fatwa on March 19, 1989, condemningRushdi and Rashad Khalifa, as apostates. TheWestern world by then knew Rushdi, but not manywesterners were familiar with the second name in thefatwa. Dr. Rashad Khalifa, the late leader of themodern reformist movement and the discoverer of themathematical code of the Quran, in less than a yearafter this fatwa, would be assassinated by a terroristgroup affiliated with the Saudi terrorist Osama binLaden on January 31, 1990, in his mosque in Tucson,Arizona.Bin Baz, in his book, quoted some verses and manyhadith to support his position that the earth is fixed.After his expressing his religious verdict of the deathpenalty for the apostates who believe in a movingearth, he included the following reasoning as hisscientific evidence:\"If the world was rotating as they assert,countries, mountains, trees, rivers, seas,nothing would be stable; humans would seethe countries in the west in the east, theones in the east in the west. The position ofthe qibla would change continuously. Insum, as you see, this claim is false in manyrespects. But, I do not wish to prolong mywords.\"Towards the end of the 20th century, a \"university\" ofa Sunni country publishes such nonsense authored bythe highest-ranking religious leader of that country!Considering the Ottoman chief clerics banned theimport and use of the printing machine for about 300years, it becomes clear why the so-called Muslimcountries are so lagging behind in civilization,socially, politically, and in science and technology.For a comparative discussion of this verse, see theSample Comparisons section in the Introduction.The Bible, because of the tampering of many humanhands, contains questionable information about theshape of earth: Isaiah [[11:12]]; Matthew [[4:8]]; Revelation[[7:1]].See [[4:82]]; [[68:1]] and [[39:5]]."

The Quran usesoaths to pull our attention to a particular object,concept or relationship. We could translate all oathsby starting with \"I pull your attention to:.\" Whenwe utter an oath we make God our witness. Thistestimony could work for us or against us dependingon how accurate our position is. Thus, our use ofGod's name in our oaths has no bearing in provingour assertion or negation. We refer to oaths topersuade our audience by using our apparentrelationship with God as concideration for contracts.If we are lying, our oath only increases the magnitudeof our lie and thus increases our responsibility. TheQuranic oaths, however, are not used to convince us;but to make us think. When God uses His creatures inHis oaths, He pulls our attention to the signs in natureand scripture to encourage us and invite us to berational, consistent, and logical.The Quran reminds us consistently that the God whoauthored the ayat (signs) of the book is the same Godwho created the ayat (signs) of the physical universe;both are products of the same God and share thesame characteristics. Besides this important reminder,the objects, events and concepts used in oaths prepareour mind for the upcoming issues or theses; theyprovide aesthetic and semantic mental pictures andreference points. For instance, do the above oathspull our attention to the ten-based and digital numbersystems? Is there a relationship between the fourthverse and [[74:33]]?

As someone who had deepknowledge in human embryology (see [[3:7]]), hebecame the first person who noticed the problem withthe traditional understanding and he rightly remindedus of the right meaning of the word, which perfectlydescribes the embryo, the hanging fertilized cells onthe wall of the uterus, like a leech. It is true that in thestages of creation of humans, starting from semen,fertilization of the egg until birth, there is no \"clot\"stage. The Quran locates alaq (hanging thing) as thestage after the semen ([[22:5]]; [[23:14]]). In his landmarkbook, The Bible, the Quran, and Science, Dr.Bucaille discusses the scientific accuracy of theQuran and compares it with the Bible andarcheological and scientific evidences. Though hisbook is celebrated by Sunni and Shiite mushriks,many are disappointed by his criticism againsthadith; he argued that the hadith fail the tests ofscience. This brave voice, however irritated theillusions of the followers of hadith and sunna. Thus,some publishing houses in the so-called Muslimcountries, published book after expunging the sectioncontaining his criticism of hadith."

In this chapter, the wife has twodifferent roles: either she is supplying more fuel forher husband in support of his bigoted campaignagainst muslims, or she is supplying fuel for herhusband who is burning himself with flames ofhatred.Some of the followers of the hadith and sunna, whoconsider the name to be only a proper name, presentthis chapter as evidence for the divinity of the Quran,by arguing that Abu Lahab could have falsified theQuran simply by professing Islam after hearing theseverses about him. This assertion is the product ofpoor thinking. If the Quran was the product ofMuhammad, Muhammad would never accept hisconversion to Islam, and would continue condemninghim with additional accusations, such as, him being alying hypocrite. And Muhammad would be right (notnecessarily in his claim of the origin of the Quran)regarding Abu Lahab, since he could never honestlyacknowledge the truthfulness of a book condemninghim to be a misguided loser; his conversion wouldcreate a contradiction. In other words, such a claimcannot be falsified, and thus cannot be used as anexample of prophecies."
