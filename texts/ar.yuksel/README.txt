This is a version of the arabic Quran text that I have received from
Edip Yuksel.  It is as original as he could get it.

It's the same as what is found on the quranix.com website.

For the current purpose i have further tuned it to adhere to the
zekr.org formatting.  For this purpose I have:
  * removed the bismallahs (:g/^\d\+|0|.*$/d)
  * added last to disputed verses of chapter 9 from quranix.com
  * removed the numbering (:%s/\d\+|\d\+|//)
