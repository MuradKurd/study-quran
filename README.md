# Study Quran

Some Ruby scripts that parse 3 translations and the original Arabic
Quran texts into a well formatted document.

Currently it is set up for a Dutch version (includes a Dutch
introduction and title page), but it is easily adjusted
for other languages.

It makes heavy use of XeLaTeX which yields beautifully typeset result,
supporting Arab text where needed.
